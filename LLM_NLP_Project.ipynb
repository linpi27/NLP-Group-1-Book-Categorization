This was a great coming-of-age book in the 1800s. I found it rather interesting. My mom said I'd like it if I liked Little Women (which I totally despised). This story was about a girl named Jane Eyre from when she was in her aunt's orphanage 'till she married. She was abused at her aut's orphange. Soon she went of to Lowood's School for Girls and became a teacher for her last 2 years. She then became a governess at Thornfield after she left school. Soon, she fell in love with the master of the place. Then, she left and became poor and homeless, but then found a job from the person she stayed with and a lot of other things happened, but that's all I'll tell you, because then you won't want to read it.

I was looking through the reviews and I found one reviewer who didn't share the view of evolution...I don't know if this guy was serious or not, because to me it sounded too far out. Now, I'm not gonna sit here and say evolution is right. Evolution is a theory, a theory that is supported by some evidence. The idea is pretty good, but doesn't mean it is right. Theories come and go. The information is presented, it is up to the reader to determine whether they believe in it or not. I don't care if you don't, just don't be a hypocrite about it. This guy (who hails from the Garden of Eden (such arrogance, no?) says that evolution is fed down the throughts of children and that the real knowledge must be given...Isn't telling children your belief without thought to anything else the same type of force feeding textbook authors do? I'm sorry to not really review the book, it's just arrogant religious zealots piss me off. I don't care about what you believe in, just love your neighbor and don't be a hypocrite.Back to the book: I used the 5th edition in AP and it was the best book I have ever seen. This text combined with my teacher helped me get a 5 on the AP exam, and that was a blessing seeing how I hear so many smart people here at my college are having trouble getting a good grade in the class.

It's obviously been around my whole life. And it seems like the type of book I should have been forced to read -- if not in high school then surely in college. But I'm so glad I finally got around to it.Jane thoroughly frustrated me throughout the book and I actually found myself yelling at the book in much the same way I yell at the Buffalo Bills whenever they do something stupid (every game they play). I also found myself hoping for certain outcomes which is funny considering the ending was written oh so long ago.Jane Eyre is a love story. But more than that, its a story of perseverance, and dedication to principles.About half way through, I convinced my 15-year-old daughter that she had to read it -- just so I would have someone to talk to about it ... and because I knew she'd love it like I do.

Judy Rogers uses mostly guitar with her songs. She has a very pleasant-sounding voice. She comes from a Reformed background - each song is well-written and pure in its doctrine. This tape has songs encouraging children to enjoy their work, to keep their conversation edifying and to listen to the words of their parents.

The Discovery of Subatomic Particles is accessible to anyone, an easy read revealing much about scientific method. It's more a history of how scientists and physicists with rather rudimentary tools devised innovative ways to probe and measure atomic particles with surprisingly accurate results. This book will be appreciated by the mechanically inclined. For the mathematically inclined, you will see in the appendices calculations developed in such a way that requires only a basic background in algebra to understand.The author guides the reader through the history of processes that refined our understanding of the subatomic world. The subject matter is covered in a logical timeline progression and consistent format. Quantum theory is outside the scope of this book, but Niels Bohr is included in the history for using some of the discoveries to formulate his view of electron dynamics. The reader will gain a higher appreciation of how much can be measured and discovered using the basic tools and instruments available at a given level of scientific development.Extensive appendices amount to a concise development of fundamental physics, itself creating much value owning this book. My favorite appendix has the author describing how much of Rutherford's formula for the scattering of alpha particles can be derived through simple dimensional analysis, continuing the historic application of basic tools to analyze, measure, and discover subatomic particles. The appendices give the technical details supporting much of the scientific development described so well in the main text. Steven Weinberg's book, The Discovery of Subatomic Particles, is an easy read that can be appreciated by anyone. The Discovery Of Subatomic Particles (Scientific American Library Series)\n",

I would revise that to say that it's the Bible of chart pattern analysis, because it doesn't go into modern technical analysis methods (indicators etc.). At any rate, it's a comprehensive book on classical technical analysis (that being chart patterns).The main down sides to this book are that it's a dry read and it lacks an evidence-based approach. What I mean by that last part is that many times the authors simply say \"in our opinion this is so\" or \"in our experience we find that this happens.\" That really equates to a focus group of one and can be a recipe for causality errors/confusion. You're essentially left with having to take the authors word for it.At any rate, it's an in-depth, detailed review of chart patterns, thus a valuable resource for those interested in an in-depth study of TA.

However, what could have been a thoughtful, ironic, heartwarming story quickly became plotless and one-dimensional. Do Patty's parents really possess no good qualities whatsoever? Is Anton really the saint he seems? This novel makes no attempt to answer any of these questions, and that's what makes it so painful to read. Patty, who is clearly intended to be the endearing heroine, comes off as a know-it-all with a total disregard for rules and boundaries. Also, doesn't a seemingly romantic relationship between a 12-year-old and a 19-year-old feel questionable at the very least?
