1568959443,In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex,,A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ,"Donald Mitchell ""Jesus Loves You!""",2/2,5.0,960940800,Indomitable Survival Overcomes Impossible Circumstances,"This story has to be one of the most astonishing tales of survival in recorded history. Before I say more, let me caution you that this story (and parts of this review) is not for those with weak stomachs.After their ship is disabled by an attacking sperm whale, the survivors find themselves on three open boats in the middle of the Pacific Ocean over 2,000 miles from their targeted landfall in South America. With luck, they will make it in 30 days. They soon find themselves in a stall as the winds fail to cooperate, except to provide severe storms that threaten to capsize the boats.Soon, all the food is encrusted with salt and everyone is suffering with severe dehydration. Then things start to get worse! I won't go further, but you have an amazing story of survival ahead of you.Two of the few survivors of this terrible ordeal later committed their experiences to writing, which provide great resources for this well-researched book.At another level, the book is also extremely interesting because these experiences were important influences on Herman Melville's writing of the American classic, Moby Dick. The book makes the connection, including how Melville came to learn the story.At a third level, the book is a fascinating history of whaling around 1920. If you are like me, you will cringe when the whalers devastate island after island. But that's not the limit to their willingness to use nature to their own advantage.The ultimate irony is that the survivors went the wrong way. Those from Nantucket did not know about Tahiti and Hawaii, and chose not to go in either of those directions -- either of which would have provided more rapid safety and comfort. The primary reason they chose not to go in these directions is because they feared running into cannibals. Soon the survivors were studying the remains of dead shipmates with hunger. And then it gets worse.So, you have three different kinds of books to read here, anyone of which could be enormously enjoyable to you. Get ready for the trip of your life!",History

IN THE HEART OF THE SEA was passed along to me by a reading friend at work. This would not have been a book I would have picked up without her strong recommendation. It is one of the best written books I've read in a long time, a scholarly compilation of information as well as a journal and a notebook left behind by survivors of the whaling ship The Essex which was attacked by a whale. This is the same story that Melville adapted MOBY DICK from. Melville, however, only had access to the journal of the First Mate, and since that time a notebook kept by the cabinboy has come to light. The author, Nathaniel Philbrick, takes those, and thoroughly researches not only the time and the industry, but the history of Nantucket, including the lives of the women (who basically ran things as whaling might require a voyage of 2-3 years) and the peace loving Quakers, who became a rather blood thirsty lot when chasing whales. The book also includes a wonderful collection of maps and photographs. [Only the BEST armchair books include maps and pictures!] The extreme arrogance of man, to cast out into huge oceans (and I mean plural, for the whalers went right around the Cape) to take on these giants of the sea. Imagine - no GPS, no radios, no tracking, no instant communications. To go after these huge sea creatures in small boats with harpoons - and once they lanced the whale it was a merry ride, like a runaway carriage. The author skillfully knits the story together with lot of scholarly research into the effects of starvation, the plundering of the whale (very much along the scale of the buffalo) and the effects on the people who live through this, the leadership or politics of the ships as well as the whaling island of Nantucket. Let me HIGHLY recommend, and ... interestingly enough the Spousal Unit LISTENED when I recommended that he should at least look at the pictures and diagrams ... and he just inquired if I ""had trouble putting the book down"" (and he is NOT a reader).",History

However, I have found it to be an excellent reference manual for generating new ideas for my animations, and I've had a fun time executing most of its small projects.When I bought this book, I had 9 months of experience with Maya, using the Mastering Maya 3 book and Alias|Wavefront's own Learning Maya 3 textbook. Both of those are excellent and teach you everything you need to know to create a solid foundation for Maya work. However, I wanted a book on Maya 4 and decided to purchase this one. So far, I've found that it is also very valuable, especially as a supplemental book to inspire new ideas and teach you special details of Maya that will take your projects to the next level, such as animating a glow or creating the simple turning of a page in an animated book.If you are just beginning to use Maya, then I would not recommend this manual. But if you have a few months of experience and want to build on that, it is an excellent source of fun tutorials and neat ideas. Additionally, the author writes in an inspiring, encouraging tone that makes the book a pleasure to read. I do, however, wish that the publisher had put more quality into the book's physical production, especially its color pictures. Nevertheless, it is a worthwhile purchase.",Computers

(Pg. 2)She notes, ""Macrobiotic diets are often lumped into the general category of vegetarian diets, even though they may include seafood. The diet excludes all other animal products, however, as well as refined sugars, tropical fruits, and 'nightshade vegetables'... Many people follow a macrobiotic diet as part of a life philosophy..."" (Pg. 14)She argues, ""Another result of the market for meat in affluent nations is the choice of those in power in poor countries to raise animals for export to the wealthy overseas. The losers are again the local people, who might have benefited from less profitable plant foods grown to feed the masses. Another downside to this practice is that in some developing nations, natural resources such as land and forest are depleted and are no longer suitable for growing the crops that could feed the masses."" (Pg. 30)She observes, ""The United States Department of Agriculture is in the business of protecting and promoting agriculture. In large part, that means advocating for the meat and dairy industries. However, the Department of Agriculture is also charged with issuing dietary recommendations for the American public. Conflict of interest? You bet... The dairy industry has historically been aggressive about providing nutrition education for the public."" (Pg. 66)She admits, ""Our need for vitamin B12 is truly miniscule, but the tiny bit that we might have gotten in years past ... isn't available to most of us now. If you eat animal products regularly, you've got a source of vitamin B12. If you don't, then you need to find an alternate source. That means that vegans, or people who eat a near-vegan diet, need to pay more attention to getting a reliable source of vitamin B12 in their diets.""

Medieval historians have long espoused the theory that the medieval European strophic song forms came directly from the Arabic tradition.

He provides full transliterated and translated lyrics to ten medieval muwashshahat, the surviving fragments in the modern nouba, and the melodies to which they are sung in the modern oral tradition.

I gave this book four stars because though it has some great advice, there are several points of supposed insight I'm skeptical about. The book appears to be based on a premise that men view women as either a ""mother"" or ""lover"", and women need to avoid becoming viewed as too motherly. How to do that? That's where it gets tricky...Sherry states a few times throughout the book that she is not encouraging playing games, but it's hard to see some of the advice as anything but game playing. Case in point, the men don't respond to words, only no contact. Although I understand her point that often times requests fall on deaf ears, I find totally not communicating the problem to be a bit disrespectful (the assumption is that men just KNOW what they did to upset you!) and withholding contact as punishing (which seems to be putting women into the motherly role, no?) What I LIKED: emphasis on being assertive and fulfilling your own needs before expecting others (specifically a man) to, coming from a place of want instead of need, giving space and each having your own life outside of the relationship, that you don't have to be a model to value yourself (or to have others value you), that men appreciate succinct communication. This is a great ""dating"" book in that it helps you find balance and not get swept away too early in the dating game and it offers good advice on how to weed out guys that are not going to step up vs. men who may have the potential to be healthy partners. What I LOVED: Sherry persistently talks about nice girls (women who give too much) vs. bitches (women who are assertive and find balance). She gives some great examples of how to spot when you are being ""too nice"" and how over-giving, over-compensating, being over-empathic are a woman's choice (as in, take responsibility for your actions, it's not all the guys fault!), but these misguided efforts will only leave you feeling tired and used. If you feel you have a pattern of putting/investing too much into relationships without getting much back, this is a great book for you! On the other hand, I'm skeptical of a few points. As I mentioned before, some of the advice IS game playing (the definition of a mind game is covert use of psychological influence), and some of the advice may stray too far away from a woman being true to herself. The greatest limitation of this book, however, is that there is no time line with Sherry's principals which makes following her advice difficult after the initial courtship. A lot of what she says is GREAT while dating, but what might work at the beginning of the relationship may be less than ideal further down the road...as one reviewer mentioned, most guys may like a chase, but eventually their feet get tired! And let's face it, most women want to stop running at some point! A specific example is the principal dealing with keeping the emotional baggage light. That is great advice while dating but what about once you've been together for a while and going through ""hard time"" stuff? Following all of her principals (all 100 of them) for a long period of time would be exhausting, even to the most vigilant lady! If you don't have the greatest memory, a summarization of the principals would have made her take home points a bit easier to remember and integrate into everyday life. (And save you the awkwardness of pulling out the book to confer during dinner with your date!)",Family & Relationships

I'm not terribly sure that I agree with the reading age though; this strikes me as being more suitable for teenagers than nine year olds.The subject matter is tragic and treated with a simplicity that is damning. Patty Bergen, a Jewish girl, befriends a German prisoner of war, seeing beyond the ""Nazi"" hatred of her peers to the person inside. She is eventually backed up by her parents' African-American housekeeper, the only other true-hearted soul in this entire story. Anton, the German soldier, is a self-proclaimed coward, but he discovers his own inner courage when it comes to the crunch.Through these three main characters, so different in their attitudes from the narrow-mindedness and sheer cruelty of the others, we learn that it's possible to go beyond the outer looks of a person and that what is inside truly counts. Patty's daydreams are poignant and sad, highlighting the difference between what she needs and what her reality actually is.The self-righteous townspeople are racists and have committed more than one atrocity in their time. And the innocence of the main character, who notices but does not quite understand, is beautifully portrayed. We get the impression that she is on the verge of losing that innocence, her belief that all people are essentially good, and the feeling of that is so sad.In a way this story is a fable - a bitter one, for sure. But I found that the story was compelling and moving, and above all thought-provoking. If nothing else, it teaches us that not all is what it seems.

She makes relationships sound like a complicated game, when in fact no game exists. Successful relationships are not chess or high-stakes poker.1. Women, stay in control, always. Why? Because you have the most to loose. Don't get married unless you are certain that you want children. Don't get married/involved in a long-term relationship unless you KNOW that you can survive, financially, independently from him.2. Kick the loser out if he is a drunk. Kick the loser out if he has a problem with drugs. Kick the loser out if he is unemployable. Kick the loser out and get the police to throw him in jail if he ever strikes you. There are plenty of men out there without these problems. Give no second chances.3. Make sure that you are sexually compatible. If sex isn't important to you, make sure that it isn't to him, and vice versa. Remember: when you are both 45 - 60, he will look better than you do naked. Average women will still look at him. Only desperate men look at middle-aged women with stretch marks. It isn't fair, but it's true.4. Find someone with compatible energy levels. If one of you is a homebody and the other isn't, it won't be a happy relationship, ultimately.5. Enjoy similar hobbies. Be prepared to give each other space. Enjoy the same or overlapping types of music, films, books. If you are an intellectual, marry one. Never yoke a stupid person with a smart one, no matter how big the love.6. DON'T GO LOOKING! Relationships aren't important until AFTER you have years invested in them. Being single can be just as emotionally and intellectually satisfying.And that's it!

Is this edition a joke?I enjoyed Jane Eyre quite thoroughly, and I will not summarize the plot here. It has been done elsewhere. This review concerns this particular edition.Perhaps I might be harsh, but it looks to me as if Dame Darcy paid a fifth grader to do the illustrations in this book. She could use some serious formal training. Perhaps she was attempting to capture some type of gothic element in her illustrations, but these poor, poor drawings do not enhance (in fact they serve as a detriment to) the beautiful language of charlotte bronte's work. They really are quite terrible, heavy-handed drawings; Darcy really should bruch up on her pen work.Perhaps they were executed under serious time constraints? Perhaps all she had access to were cheap bic pens and a half used crayola water color set? Perhaps Penguin books was looking for an illustrator to do these illustrations for dirt cheap and she?

One of these subprojects builds an entire web server you can run from your desktop, given an Internet connection and a fixed IP address, which you probably have if you have a broadband connection. The following is a summary of the book's contents:Chapter 1: Aquarium-- A multithreaded fish-swimming project with fish that swim realistically against a bubbly background.Chapter 2: Slapshot -- A multithreaded hockey game that moves. You play against the computer and set the speed. And when you set the speed in the upper 90s, you've got a good chance of losing.Chapter 3: The Graphicizer-- An image-editing and conversion tool. This one lets you read in JPG, PNG, or GIF files and save images in JPG or PNG format. You can work with images pixel by pixel, embossing them, sharpening them, brightening them, blurring them, reducing them, and so on. And you can even undo the most recent change.Chapter 4: Painter-- Lets you draw your own images from scratch--ellipses, rectangles, lines, and so on. You can even draw freehand with the mouse. You can also draw each shape open or filled, using a texture fill, a solid color fill, or a gradient fill. You can draw text. You can give shapes a drop shadow, or make them transparent. You can draw using thin lines or thick lines. You can set the drawing color. And not only can you save your work when done, you can also read in images and work on them, annotating them with text or adding your own graphics.Chapter 5: The Chat project-- In this project you create your own private Internet chat room that will keep you in touch with anyone over the Internet. All you need is Internet access and a Java-enabled web server. You can have as many people in your chat room as you like. What they type, you can see, and what you type, they can see. Type all you like--all you're paying for is the local Internet connection.Chapter 6: WebLogger-- Log access to your website. This project lets you log users who access your website by access time, authentication type, username (if they've logged in), user IP address, the URL they accessed on your site, their browser type, the milliseconds they were there for, and so on. All without their knowledge.Chapter 7: The Robot project-- This interesting project lets you control any other program by remote control; just tell it what to do. You can send text to the other program you're controlling. You can use the ALT and CNTL keys. You can send tab characters, the Enter key, or the ESC key. You can also use the mouse--just enter the screen location (in pixels) where you want the mouse to move to. Then click the mouse, right-click it, or double-click it. You can also take screen captures. If you want to automate working with any program, the Robot will do it.Chapter 8: The Browser project-- This project lets you create a fully featured browser that subclasses Microsoft Internet Explorer in your Java applications.Chapter 9: The Intercom project-- This project lets two people type across the Internet. You just start up the project, connect with the click of a button, and you've got your own connection: Everything you type into the Intercom, the other use can see, and everything the other user types, you can see. This one is a client/server application and connects directly across the Internet using its own protocol--unlike the Chat project, no Java-enabled web server is needed here at all.Chapter 10: The Forecaster project-- Displays a four-day temperature forecast for your area, starting with today's high and low temperatures. All you've got to do is to tell the Forecaster your ZIP Code, and it'll give you the forecast by reading its data from the National Weather Service and sending a JPEG image from the server back to the browser.I'm a Java multimedia programmer, and I found this an interesting collection of projects and ideas for games and utilities I am working on. It is much more interesting than all of those enterprise Java books that are necessary for getting stuff done at work, but are not that inspiring. I recommend this project-based book to anyone curious about just what can be done with Java.",Computers

For most of the routes, the author does provide a phone number to call to get more information about the route.

0736001549,Sculpting Her Body Perfect,,AGYXGZ912N4LK,L. Owen,72/75,3.0,946339200,"Worth Buying, But Not Worth 5 Stars","The first half of the book is pretty basic info that I did not find as useful as someone might who is new to resistance training. The latter half of the book outlines how to sculpt your body. For each major muscle group the author classifies exercises into three categories depending on what parts of the muscles are being worked. By doing some or all the exercise he suggests, you can sculpt your body. What I find really useful is to know each of the categories so that I can ensure that I am working all parts of my back, for example. Now I can see that there may be times that I was doing two exercises that were working the same areas. When developing my program, I will refer to each category and make sure I have selected exercises that will cover all the categories.The book does have some flaws. The author stresses at the beginning of the book that it is important to know what muscles you are working so that you can focus on them while exercising. But when he illustrates each exercise, he does not tell you which specific muscles you are working. Most other books will list the latin names of the muscles you are working, and some even illustrate the specific muscles, which is quite useful. He suggests a limited number of exercises for each category. Some of the exercises he mentions you can't find in the book (such as &quot;spider curls&quot;). When you look at the illustrated exercises, he does not tell you what category it is working. You have to keep referring back to an earlier page to figure that out. There are so many more exercises you could do for each of the categories but he does not mention them. It would have been nice if he had a chart of exercises that you could do without having to illustrate all of them. The book does not have an index either.Conclusion: I don't think the book warrants the rave reviews it's received on amazon.com and could have been organized better, but half of the book has useful info. When I first started to read it I was going to return it because the first half of the book wasn't telling me anything I didn't know already.

His whole life centered around education (life-long learning). Think about what a wonderful world we would have if children (and adults) followed this concept.

I have had a solid determination for the past four or five years, to improve my life through books and tapes, and I feel as though I've found my true calling in life... learning! This book is primarily about raising the black race from being enslaved to an educated and highly skilled race. The author was highly instrumental in bringing this process about. He was educated and completed his schooling at the 'Hampton' school with honors. He then built and directed the 'Tuskegee' school in Alabama, and devoted his whole life to service. While this book was very informative, and is considered a milestone by a true pioneer, it is a little bit monotonous, thus four stars. I would highly recommend it nevertheless. Many of the thoughts, attitudes, and sayings of Booker T. Washington have been used by modern authors and speakers, and will live forever.

She falls in love with a Nazi soldier when she is at her father's shop. He asks her what kind of pencil sharpener he should buy. He falls in love with her. Her grandmother then takes her out on a fancy train ride, and buys her new clothes. Patty loves this outing because her parents do not really understand her at back at home. Anton then escaped from the prison after her train ride with her grandmother. She feeds him, in her garage, and takes care of him, only until she has to eventually tell Ruth. He then leaves her. She often sees him walking, and calls out, but he does not hear her. One day when he actually heard her, she went inside the house and stole tons of food all for him. Later that day, her father comes home and notices a ring on her finger. She said that it was from a nice man who wanted food, so she gave it to him. Since she was so nice he gave her the ring, when it was really from Anton. Her father, as usual, got really upset at this, and suspected that he did something to her. She swore nothing happened, but with his stubborn mind, whacked her across the forehead. Ruth pampered and watched over her. Since Ruth was talking Patty's side, Patty's dad fired Ruth. It was the first time that she had ever been fired. Near the end of the book Patty hears that Anton gets killed, and is devastated. The overall book was enjoyable, but some did not really make sense. For example, even though we knew that the father of Patti was moody, it really did not make sense for him to beat her at the times that he did. When he was in the garage, and his temper rising, he slapped her across the face asking her where she got the ring. Secondly, I thought that some parts were rather slow, and did not need to be there.

This book is fabulous! The more I use this book, the more Beth Hensperger seems like a friend guiding me as I learn about my bread machine's capabilities, and I can't thank her enough.I ordered the SAF yeast from the King Arthur Flour Company and it really does make a difference. (The expiration date stamped on the package troubled me, because it was only a five months away, so I emailed King Arthur and learned that if you keep the yeast in the freezer, it will be good for a year or more. The stamped date is based on professional bakery use, where the yeast sits out in a hot kitchen every day.)I have tried several whole wheat and semolina breads, graham bread, seeded whole grain breads, and white breads, and they all turned out beautifully. The semolina bread was particularly luscious baked on the French bread cycle for a crackling crisp crust and slathered with garlic butter, as Hensperger recommends. Using Hensperger's guidelines, I successfully added gluten to other recipes that did not call for it and saw the breads rise perfectly.Beth Hensperger's talent for recipe development is amazing; her sandwich buns and pizza crusts turned out great, too! (A nice bonus is her pizza sauce recipe, which is scrumptious and very easy.) I love, love, love this book!",Cooking

Note: My review will not be revealing any plot that you can't already gather from the Family Tree. The story begins in the late 1870s with Soames Forsyte (an old-fashioned, smart solicitor and art-collector) falling in love with a penniless beauty, Irene (pron.: ""I-re-nee""). They marry but Irene is unhappy because she does not love Soames. Later, she meets a young architect, Philip Bosinney - they fall in love and have an affair. Problem is, Philip is June Forsyte (Soames' niece)'s fiance. Suspense, drama and great tragedy ensue when Soames and June find out. Some years pass. Jolyon (a cousin of Soames and an outcast of the family) and Irene are thrown together by circumstances and they fall in love. Irene has his child, Jon. Soames is heartbroken a second time. There is a bitter divorce. Soames later marries a French woman, Annette and they have a child, Fleur. Fleur and Jon grow up and fall in love with each other, unaware of the feud between their families...Note: Both the book and TV-series (adapted in 2002) feature Chopin's music (which is played by Irene on the piano). So if you like Chopin, you'll be pleased! Another thing is that the reader will either love/hate Irene. The author only describes her actions, but never let us know her thoughts or feelings. Everything we read about Irene is from the eyes or viewpoint of the other characters. Hence, on the pages, she appears cold and distant. Personally, I do not like Irene; my sympathy lies with Soames (whom I feel is unfairly and cruelly treated by Irene).Volume 2 is about Fleur and her relationship with her ageing father (Soames) and her husband (Michael Mont). Initially, Fleur appears to handle married life well - 'grooming' her husband for Parliament and throwing social parties. But 3 crises emerge to test her: a court action filed by a former friend (lots of mud-slinging here), having to ""manage"" Wilfrid Desert (her husband's best friend who is in love with her) and the return of Jon to England and their rekindled love. There is also an engaging subplot involving an impoverished balloon-seller, Tony Bicket and his wife.Volume 3 is unputdownable (like Volume 1). Here, we meet the Charwells, distant relations of the Forsytes (Michael Mont's mother is a Charwell). The time period is 1920s to early 1930s. The heroine is Elizabeth (""Dinny""), a most charming and endearing character. In Book 1, she tries to help her brother, Hubert who faces a murder charge. She also has to fend off 2 (unwelcome) admirers. In Book 2, Dinny falls in love (at last) with someone who first appeared in Volume 2. Their relationship is not smooth-sailing and you just know Dinny is headed for a heartbreak. There is also a troubling religion issue with no practical solution in sight. In Book 3, Dinny helps her younger sister, Clare who runs away after physical abuse by her husband. There is later a court proceeding (which is superbly written). Meanwhile, Fleur provides some smart advice and shows her generosity in an unexpected way. As for Dinny, she has not recovered from her earlier heartbreak but a new suitor appears on the scene (and he is really quite perfect...). Volume 3 is romantic and I loved it best.The Forstye Saga is a glorious and unforgetable read. It has the power to draw every sorts of emotion from the reader (joy, sadness, suspense, anger, laughter, tears). Put this title high on your list of must-reads. All 3 Volumes are highly recommended!",Fiction

But knowing that video/movies can only do so much for a text, I unearthed my own private copy of Galworthy's book, one inherited from my aunt, and started the discovery by print.I have been so overcome by Galsworthy's skill as a wordsmith, and so fascinated by his social commentary on this class of people, that I have broken away from the novel time and time again and done further research into Galsworthy and his own commentaries of his work, particularly on the Forsytes. From his wife, Ada's preface, through his intro, to his chosen dedications, I am enchanted. I feel remiss to not have read him before this time, but so grateful to have an old copy and to now enrich my life with these characters.While not disappointed by the TV rendering, I am glad to know Soames, Irene, Old Jolyon, Young Jolyon, June, as Galsworthy painted them. I am glad to see their physical makeup to be different than those of the actors and actresses in the PBS series, and to feel I know them much more completely now.I have a personal love of British lit and am so pleased to find such great storytelling in an older text.

087154234X,Making Ends Meet: How Single Mothers Survive Welfare and Low-Wage Work,19.2,A1S0TB8S4Y7CIQ,Nicholas Stix,6/24,3.0,1058227200,Who'll Stop the Rain?,"3 1/2 starsDuring the early 1980s, social scientists noticed that welfare mothers were spending three to six times their official incomes. In his exquisitely written foreword, Harvard sociologist Christopher Jencks argues persuasively that in a ""conspiracy of silence,"" conservatives didn't want to admit that mothers could not survive on welfare checks alone, while ""liberals"" didn't want to admit that clients had unreported resources. Jencks and his colleagues asked where the additional money was coming from. Making Ends Meet provides some answers.Aided by over thirty research associates, sociologist Kathryn Edin and anthropologist Laura Lein interviewed 379 single welfare AND poor working mothers in Chicago, Boston, San Antonio, Charleston and rural Minnesota. The authors compared the groups, with the purpose of undermining welfare reform.Virtually all of the mothers studied derived income from their children's fathers, from boyfriends, relatives, off-the-books jobs (e.g., babysitting), selling stolen goods, prostitution or dealing drugs. Despite unreported income, uneducated, unskilled women working at ""dead-end"" jobs were barely treading water.The authors report that single, working mothers have more cash, yet suffer greater hardships than their non-working counterparts. Working mothers must pay for additional transportation, and for services such as medical and child care that welfare mothers get free. Edin and Lein thus conclude that poor women are usually worse off working than being on welfare.The authors tend to exaggerate the difficulty of finding affordable child care. Although a respondent told of getting babysitting services from a welfare mother for a bag or two of groceries per month, the authors speak of ""market-rate"" (read: exorbitant, state-licensed) child care. As NYU political scientist Lawrence Mead noted in The New Politics of Poverty (1992), as Jencks corroborates, and as I know from direct experience, poor working mothers are able to negotiate affordable, unlicensed child care without ""service-providers"" from inflationary, government programs. The supposed lack of child care is a rehearsed response that welfare mothers know to give to credulous, ""Suzy the social worker"" (a term a foster-care caseworker colleague taught me) types and socialist/radical multicultural academic researchers: ""I really want to work, but ...""Edin and Lein alternate between the role of ""Suzies"" and that of dogged interviewers. They re-interview respondents who initially gave unrealistic budgets, or ambiguous or misleading answers on whether they were receiving child support, or engaging in casual prostitution. The pervasiveness of casual prostitution matched my own observations in New York's slums; that of informal child support surprised me. However, when it comes to the mothers' rationalizations for not working, it's ""Suzy time"" again. The conflicted authors emphasize mothers' concern with avoiding criminal activity, despite chronicling their involvement in prostitution, and in contracting with shoplifters to steal clothing for their children.Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty, and the Democrats' ensuing Northern Strategy's revolutionary anti-morality put dunce caps on millennia-old moral teachings prohibiting premarital sex. Armies of sexual ""educators"" and ""helping"" professionals and their university and media apologists told girls they had a right to ""non-marital births,"" and demanded that hardworking, married folks support those children. Implicitly re-defining a family as an unwed mother and child(ren), the authors are shocked, shocked, that this results in a poor, unskilled girl raising her fatherless child(ren) in poverty.(As liberal Democratic historian Fred Siegel (The Future Once Happened Here) has chronicled, the Marxist National Welfare Rights Organization (NWRO) sought to bankrupt New York City, and precipitate a revolution. From 1966-73, liberal Republican Mayor John V. Lindsay's social services commissioner, Mitchell ""Come and Get It"" Ginsberg, more than doubled the welfare rolls, from 538,000 to 1.165 million. At the same time, the NWRO pursued a politics of racial polarization, a politics it later attributed to Republicans. Instead of a revolution, the NWRO precipitated the moral collapse of urban black society.)In seeing life in ""some of the country's most dangerous neighborhoods"" as driving concerned mothers onto the dole, rather than leave their children unsupervised while they work, the authors confuse cause and effect. It is the spread of illegitimacy and welfare, and their accompanying vices, that has made such areas so dangerous.In Why Nothing Works (1987), ""liberal"" anthropologist Marvin Harris ""explained"" that welfare clients raised their sons to be violent, the better to protect the mothers (from other women's sons). Hence, to the degree that poor young blacks and Hispanics embrace crime, they do so not in response to (white) racism, or lack of opportunity, but to their rearing.Millions of American couples avoid poverty through pooling modest paychecks, one spouse working extra hours, sharing responsibilities, relying on relatives for child care and limiting their wants. The authors have unwittingly made a compelling case for demolishing the welfare state and its ""alternative"" family models. The solution is marriage.When I was a foster-care caseworker, one of my clients almost always missed agency visits to see her seven children. ""I didn't want to leave the house, 'cause it was rainin,'"" gradually became ""It looked like it MIGHT rain."" Edin and Lein deny the morality of work and responsible living, yet portray welfare clients as always a government program away from employability. But government will never be able to stop the rain, just as it will never be able to guarantee uneducated, unskilled women ""good jobs.""I doubt that Making Ends Meet will cause an uncommitted reader to suddenly empathize with welfare clients. In a New York Times puff piece, Edin inadvertently clarified the book's (for me) peculiar sensibility. Reporter Jason DeParle related that while Edin, who is white, found black children beautiful, ""white children at times began to look 'homely'"" to her. Rather than caring about ALL poor kids, Kathryn Edin apparently feels a blind loyalty to poor black women and their children, and a corresponding obligation to be repelled by children of her own race. How sad.Originally published in Chronicles: A Magazine of American Culture, February, 1998.",Social Science
0394779959,Summer of My German Soldier,,,,8/12,2.0,1029456000,Extremely Disappointing,"When I picked up this book, I thought it would help clear up rascist thoughts about Germans in the form of a story about deep friendship. As it turned out, I was more impressed with the synopsis on the back of the book than with the book itself. This book is about a girl named Patty who decides to hide an escaped German soldier in her garage. She barely knows them; barely gets to know him, and is devastated when he runs away and gets killed. If Patty hadn't blabbed a story about how he gave a ring to her to a friend (by the way, I found it stupid and unrealistic that he gave his family keepsake to a stranger) then he probably wouldn't have been tracked down and shot. And spoiled little self-centered Patty never even figured that out.At the beginning of the book, Patty was an appeally character, because she was just a little girl trying to figure out what she wanted to do with her life. There was even a bit of well-developed character that the auther could have done something with, and I have to say I felt some compassion for her, especially when she was beaten and misunderstood by her parents. Throughout the book, however, Patty went from amusing but naive to a little aggravating to rip-your-hair-out-annoying. At the end, I was extremely sick of her, and didn't like her at all.I guess the thing I disliked most about this book is that none of the characters had any understanding of the world, how it works, why people do things, or of love, compassion, or hate. There wasn't a single character who I could relate to; even the characters who were supposed to be friendly seemed cold and distant. Ruth was my favorite character. She was the only character who had any wisdom (or any common sense, for that matter), but I regret to say that at the end of the book, I grew to hate her because she told Patty that her parents would never love her. I think this is one of the worst possible things anyone can tell a child, whether it's true or not. And in this case, I believe it wasn't true (but you'll have to read the book yourself to decide). I kept waiting for some gesture of kindness, or even recognition to come from Patty's parents, but it never did.I recommend that you save your time, and not read this book. There are many books about World War II and the Holocaust that are much better.",Juvenile Fiction

B0007EI15A,The Battle for Investment Survival,,,,23/25,5.0,993168000,Perfect Crystallization of a Key Insight,"Like many of the other reviewers, I read this book after seeing it in the bibliography of a Wm. O'Neil book. While the observation that ""if you've read O'Neil's major works, you've already read Loeb"" has some truth to it, I would argue that there is at least one point that Loeb expresses even more clearly than O'Neil, i.e. the fallacy of holding a declining stock because ""it will come back."" Suppose you were forced to sell the stock today, he asks. Now, suppose you were trying to figure out the VERY BEST investment to try to recoup your loss. Would it be to repurchase your loser? Almost certainly not. To me, that question crystallizes the argument for ruthlessly cutting losses better than I have ever heard it expressed.The same point is recast in a number of different ways, e.g. the excellent chapter on ""Sound Accounting for Investors"", in which he advocates always ""marking to the market"", rather than ignoring ""paper"" losses or focusing on current income. ""Gaining Profits by Taking Losses"" and ""The Ever-Liquid Account"" bring additional perspective to the same theme.In fact one of the nicest features of the book is the way it is broken up into almost 80 chapters. The main themes are repeated several times, but with different emphases. As a result, the more one browses and rereads selected sections, the more one appreciates the strength of the iconoclastic theory of investment that Loeb advocates.",Business & Economics

Worst of all she knew that the entire, narrow-minded Arkansas town would oppose her humanitarian treatment of an eascaped German (but not Nazi) POW. The story reminds us that World War II came disagreeably close to home--not with bullets, air raids and invasion, but in a more subtle manner--by attacking the mind as well. In Greene's scenario of mass paranoia and government-promoted prejudice, there is no room for human compassion, international understanding or the budding of romance. Even pure friendship is tainted by vicious minds. But Patty is a real heroine, willing to endure social stigma and punishment to remain true to her heart. The ending was sudden and shattering.

1931800049,A Wise Woman,,AU2V2ZKMZFNY6,"JR Corry ""Jenny""",5/8,1.0,1212883200,A Dangerously Foolish woman,"All you really have to do is read this woman's views of marriage, one of God's most sacred creations, to know how unstable and often unChristian her doctrine is. I have a hunch that author Erin Thiele's doctrine twistings have more to do with a fooled mind than a malicious heart, but that doesn't make her words any less poisonous.First, Thiele begins with befouling marital submission, one of the most commonly abused concepts of marriage. Turning the concept of healthy submission into authoritarian obedience is just the beginning of Thiele's twistings; according to her, wives must always obey their husbands no matter what, even if their husbands ask them to sin! Like so many before her, in order to twist the marital doctrine, Thiele twists Biblical examples in order to support her views. She actually backs up her ""obey your husband into sin"" idea with the ridiculous claim that Sarah obeyed Abraham by lying about their relationship, and that God approved of this because He didn't punish her. God didn't bless Sarah's obedience, He saved her from bad men. This does not mean He approved of her actions or Abraham's.Indeed, Thiele does believe that you can freely sin so long as your husband tells you to first; she quite literally says, ""Women are not responsible when they obey their husbands"". I've seen this before: women like Thiele not only obey their husbands to a fault (literally), but they attempt to blame their husbands for any sins they commit. Thiele, YOU are responsible for your actions, not your husband. The only way you will escape the blame for your husband's actions is if you refuse to comply with them and leave him to his own devices. If you go along with him in sin, though, don't bother trying to pull the trick of blaming your spouse for your sin; that doesn't work for women anymore than it did for Adam. If you don't believe me, just read the story of Ananias and Saphira: both sinned and both ended up dead. I can't imagine how many gullible women might read this book and actually believe that God would not only approve of them sinning against Him at their husband's command, but let them off the hook because ""hubby made me do it"".When I say that Thiele exhorts obedience even at the face of sin, I'm not exaggerating. In fact, Thiele goes even further and claims that wives shouldn't even show resistance to their husbands, including in times of horrid treatment and verbal abuse. Thiele tells wives that even in the face of abhorrence and ridicule from our husbands, we cannot do anything but return ""blessings"". She actually uses the example of Christ not showing resistance to His haters and scoffers! Use context, please. Jesus did NOT either do nothing in the face of true evil (other than His crucifiction, which was pre-planned) or act reactive rather than proactive. There were many times when He either gently or vehemently reproved bad behavior, and He did anything but sit quietly. Another flawed and unacceptable example.Here is a summary of Thiele's comments, word by word, confirming the twisted doctrine I described:""God is clear that no matter what treatment we receive, we are to remain respectful and submissive""""We obey without even a word, especially when our husbands are being disobedient to God's word""""We are not allowed to use tough love but be quiet and gentle always""I guess beaten women are to remain ""respectful and submissive"" by not calling the authorities and letting their husbands beat them to death? Is this God's doing too? How about following our husbands into sin, and then trying to escape blame from it?Speaking of the ""no tough love"" schlock, Thiele claims that women are not even to try persuading their husbands away from sin. We are not to speak at all, she says, just to obey; no matter what our husbands either do to us or ask us to do. This is the EXACT opposite of what every other Christian author says. If you look at even the most conservative authors, they'll tell you to obey your husband EXCEPT when he sins (never ever obey him then) and, by all means, to try and persuade him away from sin. How is it that Thiele has created a doctrine that not only contradicts the Bible, but even all the other patriarchal authors?After the sickening chapters on marriage, Thiele goes on to mess up what God says about divorce. Of course she's against it no matter what; after her words on how to deal with an abusive husband, naturally she doesn't think abuse is cause for even resistant behavior. In fact, she doesn't mention physical abuse at all in her chapter on divorce. Instead, she puts all overly-conservative authors before her to shame by claiming that divorce is only acceptable when FORNICATION occurs. Not adultery, but fornication. In other words: a spouse is only allowed to divorce their partner if they discover that said partner was not a virgin upon marriage. At this point, I really didn't think Thiele could get anymore unBiblical, but I was wrong. Not only is it ludicrous to think that fornication is worse than adultery (which actually consists of breaking a holy vow AS WELL as having sex out of marriage), but nowhere does the Bible claim anywhere near the NT that it's okay to divorce a spouse based on their actions before marriage. Whatever happened to forgiveness? If you sinned with someone before you got married, that's between you and God. Yes, your spouse DOES have the right to know about your previous sexual acts, but that doesn't give them the right to act as though you were married to them and owed them loyalty before you even met. With these words, Thiele has officially proven to be living by obsolete OT law rather than Christ's law.In short, there's really nothing whatsoever I can recommend about this book, much less this author. I have literally never seen so many theological errors at one time in my life. Don't get this book, please; don't even go near it.As one last thought, Thiele claims in her chapter on submission that obeying a husband will protect a wife from deception (even, you recall, if the husband himself is the biggest fool in the world). Well Thiele, you've only served to prove to me once again that obeying a husband is the last thing a wife should ever do. Because if you're any example, obeying your husband has brought you nothing but deception of the worst sort. I'm not blaming your husband for your own behavior; that's your job.",Fiction

I enjoyed this book and was amazed by the depths to which these men sank. The writer did a great job pulling his information from all sources available for a story 180 years old. When there was disagreements as to stories, this was pointed out. By now you have probably heard the main part of the story: massive whale attacks and sinks ship, men are put in small whaling ships and set out on the sea to travel over 2,000 miles with crude navigational devices spending over 90 days on the sea. This book really describes in detail the depths the human body will go to from a physical and mental standpoint. The book becomes so engrossing you can't put it down. I do most of my reading at night but started reading early over breakfast right as the issue of cannibalism came up. Not my best move as it is studied in depth.This writer does a good job of relaying the journals kept and then translating the physical and mental effects to later studies done on starvation, particularly the Minnesota study done in the 1940s.The crew eventually splits into four groups and it's interesting to see what happens to the four groups. I particularly found it interesting they were able to determine what happened to the three crew members left on an island after refusing to get back in the whaling boat.Overall, I think you will enjoy this book. If you like this book, I strongly encourage you to read Endurance about the journey of Shackleton. It's very similar and mesmerizing how they survived in extreme cold.

1931800049,A Wise Woman,,A26TZHHGBUCU5Q,KE Felmey,5/7,1.0,1212624000,Blatant Scripture Twisting,"Scripture twisting: ""How were we freed from being slaves of sin?"" is one question posed. The answer she gives is Romans 6:17 ""But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you."" The book's filled with total importance of obedience and works. The author seems to forget Ephesians 2:8-9 ""for by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God; Not of works, lest any man should boast.""I read of the importance for a wife to obey her husband. Total obedience, even if he's a cruel tyrant. There's no grace/love in this teaching and it's completely subjugating of women. If a woman has a concern about pregnancy and birth control -- forget about the pill; out of the question. The book's full of hyperbole and fear-mongering, which is much of the Gothard-based/IBLP teaching that Thiele shares. She seems to inwardly fear the examples of husbands leaving their ""contentious"" wives to leave home for an affair. Her teachings also make little sense in regards to the idea that man leads and the woman follows (a hiearachal system in marriage she teaches), but on the other hand she explains how men won't lead unless their wives allow them to lead(?) Here's an idea: Leaders lead.It's so legalistic; don't do this; do this; don't watch television; don't use birth control; obey. Where's the Holy Spirit allowed to get a still, small Word in edgewise? She's so judgemental, page 115 ""If those who ""claim"" to be Christian stopped watching television and going to the movies, Hollywood would stop making disgusting movies!"" Does she feel the same about the movie Amazing Grace (produced by the actress Patricia Heaton from ""Everybody Loves Raymond"") or Facing the Giants movie? She calls television/movie watching a ""horrible addiction"". Her writing sounds like she resents her husband (read page 117) resolves herself to putting up with him. I wonder how much he's had to put up with her with these testimonies. Certainly there's no ""Song of Solomon"" type love a wife is encouraged in this book.Birth control: She's staunch in her belief that Christians are to ""be fruitful and multiply"" by not preventing pregnancy. I don't believe in abortion, but she takes it another step (Gothard?) and says even natural family planning is a slip into a gray area (page 147) and even says this outright twisting of the Precious Scripture to suit her purpose here: ""Once we Christians started to tolerate the ""gray"" areas beginning with natural family planning, it was then easy to slip into a darker gray, the Pill and the IUD. Now we have the black area -- ABORTION! 'So because you are lukewarm [using birth control] and neither cold [which is abortion] nor hot [trusting God entirely for your fertility], I will spit you out of my mouth. (Rev. 3:16).""She goes on to repeat Mary Pride's judgemental hyperbole from her book The Way Home. I won't bother to point out that my husband and I made the personal decision to have me get a tubal ligation after our 4th child, when she was born with 2 serious conditions that threatened her life -- double-outlet right ventricle (heart) and a twisted intestine. These conditions were likely the result of my having insulin-dependent diabetes since childhood. Oh, that's right. According to Gothard, all disease is probably the result of some sin I committed (obviously so grievous I don't recall it when I was 12) and I should've gone to IBLP conferences to deal with it. no thanks.The mishandling Revelation 3:16 should tell discerning people, those whose sins were forgiven through the life, death, burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ, that this book is full of holes and half-truths. She throws labels around to inflict pain on those who disagree (page 148) ""As a Christian, whom do you choose to believe, God or the feminists?"" Some christian women disagree with her, and so we would be labeled ""feminists"". Well, Jesus ate with the tax collectors and ""sinners"", so if it was good enough for Him to be labeled, it's good enough for me. The teaching she has on the closing of wombs is abysmal. She takes scriptures out of context.. So, now I'm a harlot, for praying/asking God for wisdom with my husband to have a tubal, to prevent the suffering in any future children I'd have. My child suffered till she died at 2 yrs. My own health was at serious risk with the diabetes, but that doesn't seem to factor into her teachings. Our prayerful steps in our marriage, along with others' prayers, is considered a ""curse"" or ""punishment"" from God according to Mrs. Thiele. My faith isn't in question, I know ""Whom I have believed"". I've also experienced a real miracle AFTER my daughter died, so I know about faith. It actually has nothing to do with my own ""works"", but everything to do with Who my Savior is. ""Aren't the children who have it all -- the toys, clothes and their own rooms -- the most ungrateful, spoiled and miserable?"" Nonsense! It's presuppositional judgement. Drugs, cults, suicide -- fear teachings if you give your kids those. ""Since you are on God's mission, He will be faithful as long as you trust Him to guide you."" It's up to you! I guess I must've mis-read the verse ""if we are faithless, he remains faithful -- for he cannot deny himself"". LOT of works taught. She questions whether it's wise to send your children off to college. Who is she to judge another man's servant? Some are sent into the world to study medicine (I'm sure she has benefitted from) helping others. College facilitates this. Book's chock full of the OT Law.

It just has a quick coating of attitude and slang, with most of the ideas coming straight out of books like The Rules (with the authors of The Rules being mentioned in the acknowledgements). The main point of this book is not how to be empowered, but how to act empowered enough to catch your guy. Then combine this with manipulation and tricks and he will be yours. This exploitation of women's insecurities hidden in the guise of empowerment is disturbing.It is based around 100 `Attraction Principles' that run through the ten chapters. These give the reader points to be aware of and rules to follow so they can catch and keep their man.She gives tips, some simple like if he is grumpy, go out and do your thing. Some are more complex: if you want to see more of him and he says he can't go away because of work, get his attention by not whining. He'll become concerned because you mysteriously no longer want it. He'll think that he no longer has a 100% hold over you and this will rekindle the flame of romance (rather than him just think there is no problem as you haven't said anything). The actual advice and `attraction principals' were very repetitive, just slight variations on what had been discussed in previous chapters.There are some parts that I agree with: having a life - but having a life because you want to have a life, not because you want to be the one in control of the relationship. `Being natural' is also brought up as men want to be with someone who is natural - and it is possible to seem natural if you follow Argov's rules. Other grating advice was more obviously in the style of The Rules: `...he should feel like the Grand Poo Bah of his habitat and domain.' Of course he is not actually the Grand Poo Bah, you will just have manipulated him to think that he is. Does honesty play a part in Argov's scheme?

Although it is something that I might be asked to read in an English class, this is my favorite book ever and I have read it many times. Nice and thick and full of details, it paints a colorful image of life in England during that time period.This book shows the struggles of poor, unwanted Jane, first in the Lowood charity school, then in her search to find a family that will hire her as a governess. This is how she ends up at Thornsfield Hall, employed by Mr. Rochester, a man who is old enough to be Jane's father. Despite this fact, Jabe slowly falls in love with him. However, Mr. Rochester is hiding a secret in the attic that could destroy his and Jane's love.This is the most romantic story I've ever read, and I recommend anyone buying it!

Matthews,32/32,5.0,1226793600,Wonderful Recipes,"Baking is my thing, even though I must cook everyday foods to survive. Because I have limited shelf space, and because I want to simplify my life, I only keep those cookbooks I use and treasure. This is one of those books. I love the recipes in this book!! They are accurate and produce consistent results. If you like glossy pictures in your cookbooks then this book is not for you, but if you want easy and tasty recipes then this is the best book in the market.In reading some of the negative reviews I would like to comment that perhaps the fault does not lie in the recipes, but in the cook. Successful baking requires quality ingredients, careful measuring and correct temperature. Of all the ingredients used in bread baking the most important is of course the flour. Not all flours are created equal, they vary in protein content and moisture. Protein helps give structure to the dough, a soft spring wheat, low protein, flour (White Lily, Wondra) is good for cakes, a high protein winter wheat flour (most bread flours) is good for breads. The moisture content of the flour determines the amount of liquid to be added to the recipe. I have found Gold Medal and Pillsbury flours have a higher moisture content than other flours and require slightly less liquid. So try the same recipes using a different flour, and check the dough before the machine goes into the bake cycle and adjust accordingly..... too wet, add flour; too dry, add liquid. Lastly, always use the same brand of flour and learn to work with it. I use King Arthur flour exclusively for consistent results.I know some of the info in this review is not necessarily about the book in question, but the info may be helpful to someone having difficulty in achieving consistent results in the baking process.",Cooking

Maybe I was expecting too much, something grander along the line of the Dune series. But the book in of itself is an extreme disappointment. I realize Asimov was young (21) when he wrote this, but his style leaves a lot to be desired. I'll take an early Arthur C. Clarke book over Asimov any day. This is the first book by Asimov I've read and I'm not sure I want to read another. His style is very dialogue driven with very few, if any, detail given to what the characters think. Everyone is very two-dimensional. And he never describes any of the scenes were all of this dialog takes place. Part of the interest in science-fiction is exploring new places, seeing different things. This entire story could have taken place on an empty stage. In fact, it seems like it's written more for a play than a novel. As for the story, it starts out interestingly enough. The Empire is going to crumble and to avoid thousands of years of dark-ages, a Foundation is set up to preserve the past learning's of the Empire. Well, that's what the original thought was at least. Soon we discover there's an alternate motive to this. Once we learn of this motive, the story goes straight downhill. Asimov skips decades from one page to another. Characters are introduced that we know practically nothing about, and he never tells us anything about them. I've read history books that had more character development than he gives the people in this book. By the time I got to the end I found myself saying &quot;So what&quot;? Am I supposed to continue on reading this series because it's been called a &quot;classic&quot;. I've seen the word &quot;classic&quot; thrown around a little too much sometimes.

(There is a detailed index as well, but unfortunately, it is not linked/click-able in the Kindle version.) I also use the Kindle's bookmark and notes features to make notes about recipes I like, or alterations I make, etc.There is also a good bit of ""general"" information about bread-baking, with helpful info so you can figure out what might be wrong if your loaf doesn't turn out perfectly. There is info about different bread-machine settings as well, and about individual ingredients in typical loaves. I found the info on wheat-gluten and SAF yeast especially helpful, and using them, I can now be virtually guaranteed of getting good results every time I bake. :)I have not found any issues/problems with Kindle formatting in this book.

And there's enough rock-n-roll trivia in here to stump the Music Nerd. One of the coolest things about God Save My Queen, it that it is so refreshing to see a straight man (the dedication is to the love of Nester's life, a woman, so I'm extrapolating here) write with such candor, warmth and even doe-eyed crush-puppy love about the bucktoothed homosexual hero of his youth.

The author's basic point is correct in principle, that no man respects a doormat, i.e. a woman who puts her man's needs before her own. However, her solution is to dispense some dumb, game-playing advice. And the book basically says the same thing over and over. The author does not seem to know the difference between having self-respect, and playing games to create the APPEARANCE of self-respect. Most men can tell the difference eventually.Despite these criticisms, I thought the book was funny and gutsy.

B000PX4W4C,George Washington Carver,,A25H58LXCC6LD,Matt Boisen,0/0,4.0,1272585600,Thoughtful product of its time,"I found this book at a used book store and remembering stories about Carver and his peanuts, thought it would be interesting to learn more. I, too, found it to be a thoughtful narration of Carver's life, from the Civil War to the years of WWII. The book was written in a contemplative style, and was definitely a product of its time, with racial terms that would certainly not be used today, but are important reflections of the age in which he lived. The early years of Carver's life are told in a dreamy, Uncle Remus-style that was popular then, and the tone was often patronizing. His later accomplishments were covered in a much more concise and respectful manner as befitting a distinguished scientist. Holt's description of the appalling treatment of Dr. Carver as he traveled around the country in the 1920s trying to promote his findings to improve the lives of those around him, was handled particularly well(mind you, this was written in 1943). The bigotry and insecurity of the Southern white population, the KKK, and Jim Crow laws are documented to remind us how far we really have come. Imagine inviting a scientist to speak at a convention, but not allowing him to sit down at the banquet in his honor because of his skin color? Making him stay at the ""colored YMCA"" several blocks away instead of the hotel in which the speaking engagement is booked? Not letting him use the lobby elevators to get to the ballroom? He wasn't allowed to have white students working with him, even if they were from the North or a foreign country. Much of his work was pirated by Southerners without attribution because they didn't want to admit that a Negro knew more than they did. And still, the man persevered for the betterment of all of his countrymen. The last part of the book becomes a somewhat hurried listing of his accomplishments and the honors heaped upon him. But through it all, there are glimpses of the man, the artist, the gardener, the serene soul whose idiosyncrasies made him so human. You feel the author had a warm regard for him, and indeed, had worked with him for three years to produce this very personal ode to a great man. I highly recommend this book.",Juvenile Nonfiction
0681994851,Jane Eyre,,A343OR9AJE0DZM,Tracey,2/2,4.0,1333152000,Not what I expected,"Some spoilers are inevitable below, if you don't already know the basic plot.As part of a new series of Goodreads challenges, it was required of me to read Jane Eyre, and I wasn't too thrilled. I've started it before and never penetrated too far. But it was in exchange for the other person watching half of Firefly (it's a shared challenge - two of us read a book apiece in exchange for all the episodes), so ... I will do a great deal for Mal Reynolds, I said.I have a paperback, somewhere, but wound up reading it via literature.org for some reason - where, I should warn, there are a great many typos, and a startling use of all caps where I believe the original uses italics. It's odd to see Mr. Rochester exclaim in the manner of a web post.I was surprised at how very much I enjoyed this. The language has proven a barrier in the couple of times I've started it in the past - no patience for it, or something. But this time having to read it out of Browncoat devotion combined with the right mood and receptivity, and I clicked with it. The sense of humor of Jane and therefore of Charlotte Bront was a wonderful surprise; there was a snark and sarcasm and a touch of simple silliness which for some reason I never suspected in either Bront or book. My prejudgment of the book was purely as a girl's dark and Gothic ""tale of woe"", built with archaic language - and that is a big part of it, yes. (After all, Helen at fourteen is given lines like ""she gives me my meed liberally"" and ""collecting all she says with assiduity"", which simply leaves me wondering if children actually did speak this way in 1847, and my goodness has civilization degenerated if they did). But it's also fun, especially when Jane converses with Mr. Rochester.""Am I hideous, Jane?""""Very, sir: you always were, you know.""""St. John dresses well. He is a handsome man: tall, fair, with blue eyes, and a Grecian profile.""(Aside.) ""Damn him!""--Jane as a child: Poor little precocious wretch. She's obviously much smarter and sharper and more thoughtful (in terms of giving thought to things more than solicitous; she is that, but not overwhelmingly so) than everyone around her - never an easy situation even for someone with a sweet disposition. Jane does not have a sweet disposition. This is undoubtedly due in part to how she's been treated all her life by the Reeds, but she fights fire with fire, no question. She's mad as hell and not going to take it anymore.And that's kind of a surprise. I haven't read so very much 19th century literature, but I have some familiarity with the stuff - and in my limited experience there weren't very many pre-Jane heroines like Jane. I'm thinking of course of Little Nell, the sweet and uncomplaining little orphan of The Old Curiosity Shop, who may or may not be the archetype, and also the much put-upon Fanny Price.Jane Eyre ain't no Little Nell. In fact what just struck me is that she is, in many ways, identical to the pre-Hogwarts Harry Potter. (Someone somewhere has to have done a study of orphans in young adult literature, a comprehensive list and investigation into why they're so prevalent. I can think of half a dozen immediately - Jane, Harry, Anne, Heidi, Oliver Twist and David Copperfield - and Pip. Seven. And then there are all the poor motherless ones, who are probably double in number.) Jane doesn't blow up her aunt, but she does attack her cousin. Her presence was resented, only tolerated out of duty to the dead, and she was ill-treated by everyone in the house to one degree or another, particularly by her male cousin. School came as a surprising solace - at least I was surprised, because again the impression I had formed was a terrible one, all Snape and no Gryffindor. And it actually wasn't. Even at its worst it was well-intentioned and there were positives; once it received reforming attention it improved drastically.It is in some ways so very much a product of its time, with its solid Christianity and its xenophobia (""a sound English education corrected in a great measure her French defects"") - but Jane is a creature of the book's future. Mr. Rochester was incorrect: Jane was not a fairy. She was a time traveler. (Now I want to write that version. Never mind Jane Slayr, this is better.) She is independent, or wants very badly to be, and she is strong in ways women are not expected nor really desired to be in 1847. She has wings, and wants to spread them; the horizon line is too confining for her. And somehow it feels very modern that she is uncertain of her footing when people are kind to her, that she is in some ways more comfortable with rudeness, and can stand up for herself quite well in its face.At this remove, without a lot of research, I don't know if the Gothic themes in this book would have been something its contemporary audience would have been familiar with; my impression is that they would. The ""madwoman in the attic"" was apparently a time-worn plot device even then. In a way it was more fun reading it with a fair idea of the ending - even though I've never read it before I knew much of the plot. Even knowing the spoilers, it had some deliciously creepy moments, and Jane never succumbed to the usual behaviors of the swoon-prone Gothic heroine. She acquitted herself quite well.",Literary Criticism

But even this is not enough. It seems that the book is hastily compiled. I would like to comment also about the models used in the book - personally, the don't have the look of someone working out or anything, with the impractical long coiffed hair and all that, that sometimes hid an essential part of the form during the exercise, like the shoulder. It would be more realistic to dress them as regular gym-goers do - like tying their hair up, for example, instead of having them look as if they're going to a pub.

How do I make a ""green screen -or a blue screen"", for that matter or how do I make a landscape?Yes, silly enough for a seasoned Maya user but not for the one who's been through too many a frustration to find these solutions through tinkering and going through so called ""Mastering"" type of Maya manuals that apparently have a lot to offer but when you're just struggling to barely get off the ground they just keep you from soaring.But here comes this little book, barely a few pages with as little text as is neccessary and,my God! in color!, now here my heart takes a jump and, man! am I ever glad that this ""little"" book is just so great, that it does so deliver!!!A year ago I saw ""The Sphere"" film which has quite a cool intro done by Imaginary Forces. At the time I was starting on After Effects and not only had I some material to work on (find out how it was done, the text effects mainly) but also material to research with: the Meyer's AE in Production book which is close to the bible, not only for it's invaluable amount of info but also for the way it's been written and the graphic layout of the book itself.Six months ago I opened a Maya demo for the first time having provided myself with 3 well known manuals as an investment looking forward to emulate some 3d stuff that had inspired me to try Maya and almost 4 months followed in which I almost threw everything in thegarbage. But when I cooled down and thought about it all came down to the documentation, to the manuals. It was a situation pretty much like in school where not all teachers are actually ""communicators""I bought this book a week ago, and even when each chapter may be carried out in about an hour I took 2 days for ch. 29, the Magic Lens and 4 days for ch. 24, Wild Things.This book is for the tinkerer, for the one that needs to quickly understand a basic concept with a basic yet practical example and then use these tools to experiment further.I wouldn't recomend it for the non-imaginative mind, the straightforward thinker, this is not a &quot;direct&quot; book.I used the idea of the Magic Lens lesson with different lens shapes, sizes, distances and combination of 2, 3 and 5 glasses emulating the positions and shapes of different lenses on my 35 mm SLR camera and, man! I could have spent a month rendering different results; then changed type, even replaced typography for objects...And now for wild things, Paint Effects had never been introduced (to me) through bibliography in such a simple manner as 30 studies in 3D has: 4 days into it and with such a simple lesson here I am expanding, taking the painting idea in 2D and enhancing a texture here or a sky there, taking the 3D painting concept and exploring the concept of painting a realistic landscape, taking the Environment Sky and testing for optimal settings, taking the Depth of Field concept that up until now, I don't know why I could never understand and now it's all so clear, experimenting with creative focusing, and man!, this is the tip of the iceberg, I'm just a damn begginer!Max, the only regret I have about this book is that it's only under 200 pages, I've only done 2 chapters, browsed through the rest picking up info and getting ready to dive in for them and I want more than I have ahead of me.I wish I'd speak german so that I could read your other book.

Jane Eyre, a plain and poor girl, a cast out among her known rich relatives, tried to make her way in this world when she advertised for governess position and received a call from Thornfield Hall. In this place, she was presented with a very agreeable student and company, Mr. Edward F. Rochester. The courting game began slowly but surely towards Jane who was still a naive girl of eighteen. Together they overcame their differences such in age and had planned to be married soon. But a terrible secret broke out and Jane fled from the Hall, leaving her crushed love behind. In her sanctuary, she found another kind of suitor in the form of a cousin, St. John Rivers. She loved him as a brother and she thought the feeling is mutual until a proposal came and the true character of St John revealed but still with power to control her resolution, in the name of his holy purpose. Right at that moment, a supernatural thing happen (which I guarantee will cause your hair stand on end) that called her back to the beloved Thornfield Hall and its master. I don't think this event was out of place. In fact, it served as the last, elegant seal on the round up.A profound love story with two unlikely characters. No beauty beyond compare and no handsome prince 'beauty is in the eye of the beholder'. Through this tale, Ms Bronte also conveyed her opinion and principle about love, marriage, physical display, conceited faith, gender equality and sound educated mind, especially of women.Her style in expressing the main characters' personality and principal was a thorough exploration of the mind and heart without too much side comments which often sidetracked a narrative. Expressive dialogs and vivid description were her main strengths that I like most. Though it is still consistent with the writing style of its era, it will reward satisfactorily every modern reader who faithfully peruses its chapters.",Literary Criticism

B0007ERZKW,Burton;: A biography of Sir Richard Francis Burton,,API2SON9CHE76,dowden@voicenet.com,25/27,5.0,882662400,Great book about a fascinating man,"I have read several biographies of Burton and this is by far the best. Byron Farwell has produced an excellent biography of a unique Victorian who led a life of incredible energy and movement. In fact, Burton seemed to find it impossible to stay in one place. Not always a likeable fellow, Burton lived for adventure. His dangerous journey into the Islamic holy city of Mecca , dressed as a Muslim and speaking fluent Arabic, vies with his discovery of Lake Tanganyika (with Speke) as the most famous of his exploits. But Farwell also describes many less well known adventures - Burton travelled to Salt Lake City in 1859 where he interviewed Brigham Young. He was British Consul in West Africa, Damascus, and Santos, Brazil. Burton usually completely ignored any duties he was given by his employer (Farwell says he was &quot;unemployable&quot;). Incredibly, much of his exploring was done while on dubious sick leave from the Indian Army. Farwell brings out Burton as an explorer of cultures and a scholar as well as a geographic explorer - Burton translated the Arabian Nights and other major oriental works. I particularly enjoyed the chapters on Burton's early life, starting as an extremely naughty boy and maturing into an exceptional young swordsman who wrote a book on bayonet drill later adopted as the standard work by the British Army. Farwell is clearly fascinated, as well as sometimes exasperated by his subject.",Biography & Autobiography

B000I83ZJC,The Forsythe Saga,,A73QPH7NGI0DJ,Sean Curley,1/1,5.0,1281312000,Galsworthy's whole opus.,"John Galsworthy (never ""Sir John"" only by his own choice, though he did accept the Order of Merit), one of the notable British writers of the first quarter of the 20th century, has subsequently faded somewhat from the canon of British writers in the 20th century, despite his winning the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1932. Galsworthy was a very traditional Victorian/Edwardian writer in his style, despite making his books social criticisms of Victorian/Edwardian values; his best work coincided with the rise of artistic modernism, which has tended to overshadow his more traditional approach. ""The Forsyte Saga"", a collection of three novels linked by two short stories, is Galsworthy's magnum opus, and has been twice adapted by the BBC into major miniseries (first and most famously in 1967, and again in 2002); it has lingered moreso in the public consciousness than its author. This large volume collects the entirety of the original quintology (some spoilers follow).The first (and, originally planned to be the only) novel in the series, ""The Man of Property"", was published in 1906, and set in the high Victorian period, focussing on the Forsyte family, the numerous long-lived sons and daughters of Jolyon 'Superior Dorset' Forsyte, and their own descendants. There is Old Jolyon ('Superior''s eldest son), who has estranged himself from his son Young Jolyon for the latter's scandalous affair, and has raised his daughter June, who is engaged to an architect; and Soames Forsyte, the son of Jolyon's brother James, who is married to Irene, and commissions the architect to build a house that he hopes will help revive the passion in his relationship with Irene.Galsworthy's twin focuses, which carry on through the whole series, are the strictures of Victorian values of commerce and proper behaviour (which particularly impact the two Jolyons), and the subordinate legal position of women in society (though the ridiculous divorce laws also hamstring men, as we later see). These carry on through the subsequent novels, published more than a decade after, and the two short stories (the second short story, ""Awakenings"", is honestly pretty throwaway, but ""Indian Summer of a Forsyte"" is lovely). Galsworthy's writing style is eminently restrained; Soames' decision to force himself on his wife Irene near the climax of the first novel is only described briefly in a single paragraph, and the nature of this act is never verbalized (or even narrated) by anyone for almost the entire remainder of the trilogy, even though it is absolutely essential to understanding what's going on. Stiff upper lip, indeed. The characterization really sells the story; the plots are frequently not anything to write home about (the third novel even opens with a quote from ""Romeo and Juliet"", which would tell people in fair detail how the entire main storyline will play out, until the very end, which is more muted).Recommended.",Fiction
B000I83ZJC,The Forsythe Saga,,,,20/25,3.0,905040000,WHO NEEDS HAPPINESS WHEN ONE CAN HAVE APPEARANCES?,"Re: THE MAN OF PROPERTYStep into the world of upper middleclass London of the late Victorian era, staunchly embodied in the several brothers Forsyte, their sisters, children, inlaws and grandchildren. It's a world motivated by keeping up appearances and exercising the strictest control over expression of one's emotions -- that is, if one is to preserve one's status as a proper member of the upper middleclass. Indeed, the only safe emotion is curiosity about how much others have paid for their possessions and whether they are to be congratulated or envied for acquiring something for nothing, or shall they be sneered at and ridiculed for having paid more. The Forsytes are a commercial bunch, everything boils down to financial value for them -- even relationships bear price tags.Old Jolyon is patriarch of the Forsyte clan. Unlike his brothers, he is now scornful of that middleclass ethos they so highly value, often to their detriment. Old Jolyon has lived long enough to regret his deference to appearances, which had cost him his relationship with his only son.The author's indictment against the stern, uncharitable principles cherished by the British upper middleclass is peppered throughout the narration, the characters always replacing any thoughts toward generosity with sound justification (read: excuse) for niggardly self interest. We are used to categorizing characters as victims, villains and heroes. However, in this story it can be argued that everyone is a victim; there are no real heroes or real villains. Because of his unsympathetic nature, cousin Soames might appear a villain, but truly he is as tragic a figure as Mr. Bosinney (the fiance of June, Old Jolyon's granddaughter) who is in love with the tragically beautiful Irene, Soames's wife. Although the reader is generously privy to the thoughts and feelings of the members of the clan, including disagreeable inlaws, it is noteworthy that the reader is only aware of the two tragic characters, Bosinney and Irene, as they are observed by others. The author never allows the reader to trespass directly into their souls to expose all therein. Fortunately for us, these two wear their hearts on their sleeves and others are thereby enabled to read volumes simply by taking advantage of brief observations. We see the reactions of Irene and Bosinney, never their internal motivations.The title of this book begs the question, exactly who is the man of property or to which man of property does the title refer -- and what exactly is the property that is referenced. Ultimately cousin Soames is the man specifically identified in the title, and surely the property particularly stressed is his unyielding wife, the incomparable Irene. Irene is so much the sophisticated lady, so beguiling in appearance and manner, I am reminded of Jane Austen's &quot;dear Jane Fairfax&quot; (&quot;Emma&quot;) who, like dear Irene, has no money of her own and therefore is compelled to select between the lesser of two (or more) quite unattractive situations. For certainly, when one's station is so reduced, being without the means to _choose_ between this pleasant possibility and that pleasant circumstance, one simply must _decide_ which evil will produce the least harm. In The Man of Property, everyone is selecting -- sometimes their choices backfire and then they must decide the next step. June happily _chose_ to become engaged to marry Bosinney, but later she has to _decide_ how best to keep him or even whether she is at all capable of keeping him.Bosinney also brings to mind another brooding young man from literature -- Mr. Ladislaw of George Eliot's &quot;Middlemarch&quot;, who also was tragically in love with another man's wife. Indeed, when reading the description of Bosinney's high cheek bones, casual manners and the intensity of his emotions, one might be tempted to cast the actor Rufus Sewell in that role; for Sewell's portrayal of Ladislaw was quite memorable in the Masterpiece Theatre television adaptation of &quot;Middlemarch&quot;, another story about keeping up appearances and making happy choices or miserable decisions.The Man of Property moves along very quickly. The author's descriptions of the lifestyle and environment of that time are quite detailed. But for the selfish and unpleasant people who populate this world, the sensitive reader might easily drift into this other time and other place, which for this reader is the mark of a truly rich literary experience.",Fiction

Part of me thinks it intellectually weak to have enjoyed so much this work, as it is on one hand a simple survival tale.

The tale is interwoven with a history of Nantucket, details on the whaling business, a survey of survival psychology, a highlight history of maritime disasters, a primer on Moby Dick, and a light geography on/geology of Pacific island outposts; all this with the added candy of a full-blown preface, endnote and bibliographic frame.

Nothing strange there - lots of music books are written by fans. The difference is that Nester - also a New York poet - takes his fandom seriously; he considers it a suitable topic for poetry. And why not? Post-baby-boomers tend to define themselves by their cultural affiliations - whether you like the Smiths or System of a Down, pop taste articulates your personality, your stance towards the world. Nester's prose poems - one for every Queen song - go well beyond the traditional tribute. They explore the odd, obsessive mindset of the fan, the curious distance and closeness he feels towards his chosen object. The poems are madly associative in the Beat tradition but also toy with a pedantic scholarly bent, particularly in the hilarious footnotes. This bold work deserves to be read and discussed.",Music

0567088308,Unexpected Way: On Converting from Buddhism to Catholicism,38.19,A33R7PDE707N20,Stephen Triesch,29/58,2.0,1124928000,A Dry and Pedantic Conversion Story,"Stories of conversion have a long history in the Christian tradition, and some of these accounts are among my all-time favorites, e.g., St. Augustine's ""Confessions,"" Thomas Merton's ""The Seven Storey Mountain,"" and Fr. Seraphim Rose's ""Not of this World."" In my opinion, Paul Williams' ""The Unexpected Way"" falls well short of those classic spiritual autobiographies.Although there are occasional biographical and anecdotal asides from Williams' daily life, most of the book consists of Williams' philosophical arguments in defense of Catholic Christianity and against the Mayahana Buddhism which he practised for most of his adult life. Thus we find a rehash of the traditional arguments for the existence of God, arguments for the survival of the human personality after death, arguments against reincarnation, arguments for the resurrection of Jesus, and so forth. Insofar as Williams is a philosopher by profession, this didactic style is perhaps to be expected, but since I myself was a philosophy major in college, much of this has a ""been there, done that"" quality for me. Quite frankly, I often found my mind wandering when reading this book. Perhaps it will have greater immediacy for those who aren't accustomed to philosophical debate, and for whom disputation of these ideas represents a new experience.Williams is far less succesful in making Christianity seem alive and vibrant than Merton, Chesterton, or C.S. Lewis did in their day, and I would refer readers to those authors for conversion stories and/or Christian apologetics that are far more engaging.Moreover, in defending traditional Catholic doctrines, Williams often falls back upon appeals to ecclesiastical authority rather than engaging in a real critique to see how well those doctrines are grounded in scripture and whether new understandings are possible. The efforts of men like Thomas Merton and Bede Griffiths to revisit old teachings in the light of new knowledge seem antithetical to Williams' approach. As a new convert, he does not want to rock the boat.",Religion

He explains what led his to Buddhism in the first place, the important spiritual and philosophical differences between it and Christianity, and why he ultimately decided that the Christian claims and view of life was preferable. In the course of the book he tackles the nature of God in the theistic religions; the nature of the `self'; animals and reincarnation; the problem of evil; and the claims of a historical Church.Williams is a long-standing Budhist scholar, and his perspective on these issues, while personal, is heartfelt and profound. The book is well written and often humorous.

B000PBZH6Q,Foundation,,A1XNXHTPQRACRO,Barry C. Chow,1/2,5.0,1001376000,&quot;Classic&quot; is an understatement,"I liked Star Wars. But for those of us who knew and loved the Foundation trilogy as one of the greatest masterpieces in all of science fictiondom, it was galling to hear the misplaced accolades heaped on the movie lauding its originality.Asimov's seminal universe was created decades before Lucas's derivative one, and Lucas shamelessly lifted whole passages of ideas, themes and settings from Asimov. The idea of a galactic empire; the conflict between an established empire and a fledgling but vital upstart; a world-girdling city at the heart of galactic government; a noble elite with incredible mental powers; a mysterious antagonist possessing the same mental powers but directed towards dark conquest; even the robots are there (albeit from a different Asimov source).I mention these things not to disparage Star Wars but to elevate Asimov. Today, it is too easy to forget just how original and inspiring the Foundation trilogy was when it first appeared in print. In the intervening decades, lesser imitators have copied, twisted and diluted the original story so often that its brilliance has been buried under mountains of mediocre muck.This trilogy has so much going for it that it is hard to know where to begin. For one thing, it is tautly written. Asimov would tend towards bombast later in life, but not here. For another, it sustains bold visions and landscapes of truly cosmic proportions. It also strikes the right note in setting the lives of a group of protagonists against a backdrop of immense historical forces. In so doing, it attains the weight of epic.Mostly, it astounds us with the sheer power of its imagination. I have already alluded to its many firsts, but it is what Asimov does with these firsts - the subtle way he folds them into the very substance of his story - that distinguishes this work. Take the theme of psychohistory. Asimov coined this term for his premise that all of human behaviour is reducible to a complex set of mathematical equations. He translates this abstraction into a storyline that is so compelling that we never think to question the outlandishness of his premise.This is science fiction at its finest: the marriage of science with fiction, all done with such consummate skill - the one merging so seamlessly into the other - that we are never aware of where the one ends and the other begins. Do not pass up the opportunity to read this trilogy. In the science fiction universe, it is the work of a grand master at the height of his calling.",Education

I found the delivery of material particularly in the `modern' topics to be much more accessible than in either Gujarati or Enders. Some knowledge of statistics and some elements of mathematics are required, but as I quickly learned, any text on econometrics at this level requires these skills. Some authors try to overcome this hurdle by including reviews of statistics and matrix algebra either in an appendix or in an introductory chapter. Watson &amp; Teelucksingh do not do this. They present any required techniques in the body of the text . While for me in a few instances the necessary skills required reference to introductory statistics texts, I found this to be more convenient than the summaries that are found in the appendices or introductions of other econometrics texts. After all, such summaries are typically attempts to fit elegant theoretical constructs into a few bullet points. My recommendation to the post-grad student to whom econometrics is new is to use this text and where necessary support it with whatever statistics text you were comfortable with at undergrad level.",Business & Economics

More than six decades and nine editions later, Robert Edwards and John Magee's Technical Analysis of Stock Trends is still considered the gold standard of technical analysis based trading. The current 9th edition has been updated to stay relevant in the current environment.The editor starts off with an introduction on how he went about adapting this classic. However, it quickly jumps into a lot of theoretical trending information with very detailed coverage of the Dow Theory from the basic theory to specific examples in the past. The authors then discuss various trends including my favorite the Head and Shoulder trend line to help you predict which direction a stock will move based on past data. Several examples (over 200) are introduced to make sure the reader has understood this concept. I really liked that the editor pointed out the uncertainty with following such a trend system but at the same time promoting its benefits. The authors also outline the different strategies (options- either put or call) based on the predicted movement of a particular stock.The second half of the book is devoted to specific tactics that can be utilized during different market conditions. Essentially, the authors break up the different theories into ways that you can apply them. For example, if you are deciding to invest in an energy sector company during a bear market with a Triangular Trend pointing to an upwards movement in price, you can navigate through to figure out the various metrics you need to chart (P/E ratio, revenue, profits, etc) in order to determine the optimal time to invest and the investment tool (stock versus option). The authors also devote a short time to explaining similar trending patterns and tactics in the commodity market.Overall, I have mostly positive things to say about this book. However, this book is more useful as sort of an instructional manual when trading stocks. If this is your first time investing I would not recommend reading this book. Instead, get something like Stock Trading for Dummies, so that you can be familiar with all various investment terminology. Then, open an investment simulator account for free using Investopedia or a similar platform and as you start reading this book practice the tactics on your simulated investments. Keep referring to the book as you make decisions about your portfolio. The tactics in the book, although they might seem technical at first, are actually very easy to chart using Google Finance, Morningstar, or similar. So, hold on to this book as a reference so that you can finally start making data driven decisions instead of just trading based on a stock tip from your buddy!",Business & Economics

In this book, which despite the title is largely about the American CIA rather than the Soviet KGB, you read about many of the ways the CIA has failed.Those failures started almost from the first day the organization existed. There were almost comical attempts to overthrow Enver Hoxha, the communist dictator of Albania. They failed to predict the North Korean invasion of South Korea and they completely overestimated the response of the Cuban people to the invasion of the island at the Bay of Pigs. Their assassination attempts against Fidel Castro were ridiculous and I still remember Senator Edward Kennedy laughing at some of their reported antics during the hearings conducted by the Church committee in the `70s.The CIA also completely failed to understand how weak the Shah's regime was in Iran and how hated his secret police were, which were largely trained by the CIA. His downfall, like that of the Soviet Empire in Eastern Europe was completely unanticipated.The years between 1946 and 1991 are generally called the Cold War, because the rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union never reached the point where forces from both sides were shooting at each other. However, to the people in nearly every other place on Earth, the war was very real. We tend to think of the millions that were killed in Korea and Vietnam when exceptions are considered and this is due to the American involvement in those places. Less well known and generally unconsidered are the small, brutal wars where the CIA was involved. Places such as Chile and Argentina, where the CIA backed military coups that led to internal ""dirty wars"" when the military forces executed thousands of their opponents.No American citizen can read this book and not be alarmed at the horrendous record that the CIA has amassed over the years. There is an old joke that Central Intelligence Agency is a contradiction in terms and the events recounted in this book make it sound like a truism rather than an attempt at humor.",Biography & Autobiography

A truly fascinating observation of Einstein's work notes that the &quot;energy released by a moving body is larger than when at rest by an amount proportional to the square of its velocity&quot;..e=mc2 was originally expresses as m=e/c2.After the nucleus we descend further into all the subatomic particles.

B000MCBOOW,Wolf-Woman,,,,2/4,4.0,1038182400,DB's Wolf Woman Review,"Wolf-Woman by Sherryl JordanWolf-Woman is about a girl named Tanith who was an Indian of an unknown tribe. The Indians had put her with wolves to be found by someone else. Ahearn, the leader of a village, found Tanith. Ahearn's village was not an Indian village. Tanith is brought to live in the house of Ahearn. Ahearn's wife, Nolwynn, is happy to adopt Tanith because she had lost her own child.Later on, Nolwynn dies. Everyone was sad for a few weeks. Then Ahearn got remarried to a woman named Morag. Morag and Tanith don't get along. So Morag sends her on a task. While Tanith is gone, Morag tells Ahearn she ran away. When Tanith returned, Ahearn sends her away. She returns again later and she discovers that when Ahearn had been looking for her, a bear had attacked him.Tanith is given a medicine in the village to make her think wolves are bad when it is discovered that Tanith has been visiting the wolves again.She falls in love with a man the same age named Gibran. Tanith goes with Gibran to a village where he was born. When they get there, they are given gifts and presents and have a big feast for Gibran's return. While visiting Gibran's village, Tanith starts to see things and when she recovers she sees that Gibran had a cut on his face, and realizes that she has done it.She runs back to her former village and finds that four of the wolves that she had known and loved are lying dead on the ground in front of the village. Tanith runs into the forest to the fifth wolf that has not been killed. She finds out that the wolf has mated with another female wolf and that they have wolf cubs.My favorite character was Tanith because she can understand the wolves, is friends with them, and was living happily with the wolves. Tanith has to choose which cry to answer: the wavering, longing bellow of the human or the steady, beating call of the wolf. I also like Gibran because he is strong, brave, kind, fierce, and soothing to Tanith, and he just seems like a really nice, caring guy. I also like him because it does not seem to bother him that he is not Indian and Tanith is an Indian.I recommend the book because it is an exciting story. It is an adventure that makes you want to know what is going to happen next. There is sadness and anger in the book but I liked that because it made the story seem realistic. There is also happiness because Tanith gets to be with the wolves again.My opinion of the book is a 9 out of 10 because they don't explain a few things very well such as not saying from what tribe Tanith comes. I wish they had a sequel for the book.",Social Science

B000PBZH6Q,Foundation,,A2ITEMEL0DTX8A,Ritesh Laud,6/6,5.0,1011398400,The continuation of an epic series,"Foundation and Empire is the second of the original Foundation trilogy written in the 1950s. The first book is Foundation and the last is Second Foundation. I enjoyed Foundation but I liked F&E; quite a bit more! Foundation consists of five disconnected short stories, too short for adequate development of the settings or characters. F&E; is much more focused, containing only two stories, the second of which really impressed me.A quick refresher on the background: The psychohistorian Hari Seldon was able to mathematically foresee the future of human society in the Milky Way. It wasn't pretty. Socio-economic forces were to cause the total collapse of the Trantorian Empire and lead to 30,000 years of anarchy and barbarism before a new empire restored peace and order. However, Seldon saw an ""alternate path"" that could reduce the duration of the Dark Ages to a single millennium. He established two societies (called Foundations) to bring this change about.In Foundation, we learn how the fledgling First Foundation established itself after Seldon's death and how it grew powerful. In F&E;, Seldon is long dead and the First Foundation faces much more serious threats: a war with the dying but still powerful Trantorian Empire and a war with a mutant leader called The Mule who possesses incredible powers. The part about the war with the Empire is a straightforward narrative with a couple interesting twists. The second part about The Mule takes place a few decades later and is written in the style of a mystery, sort of like the first two Robot novels.Since The Mule is an individual of extraordinary power, Seldon's psychohistorical predictions for the First Foundation are in jeopardy because they deal only with masses of people and large scale socio-economic forces. Hence the second part is a more exciting read. :-) Also, until the end of the second part the Second Foundation is a mysterious society on the other side of the Galaxy about whom we know next to nothing. Although I guessed the nature of The Mule's powers, I did not guess his identity and it was a great surprise for me when it was revealed at the end. The events of the last two chapters are stunning and really make you want to rip into the third book. Yet F&E; doesn't end on a cliffhanger and is quite satisfying in and of itself. This unique blend is a testament to Asimov's genius as an author. Also, you'll learn why the mutant calls himself The Mule and it's quite enlightening!With novels written later, Asimov tied together three series into one huge one! I recommend reading the entire 14-book series in the following order: the four Robot novels, the three Empire novels, and the seven Foundation novels (the original trilogy plus two prequels and two sequels). So far I've yet to read the last three Foundation books (Second Foundation, Foundation's Edge, Foundation and Earth), but so far most have been excellent and all have been well above average.",Education

Charlotte Bronte makes ghosts seem dull and spirits and fairies positively mind-numbing. All of Jane Eyre's encounters are couched in a style thats drier and staler than moldy bread. Fire? Murder? wild spirits? its all here. But none of it is the least bit worthwhile to read.In the end, we have a heroine that has wandered from place to place and eventually settles down ith her past love, Rochester, once he has 'redeemed' himself by his courage in trying to save his mad wife (in the attempt he loses his sight and an arm).In typically fairy tale fashion, Rochester gains his sight back. I have a suspicion that he would have grown another arm if we gave hima few more years.The book that Jane Eyre reminds me most of is 'The Scarlet Letter'.

B0007EI15A,The Battle for Investment Survival,,,,66/72,5.0,853372800,The psychology of a sustained bear market,"This is a book to challenge every preconception you have about investment. The world today is full of buy and hold investors (isn't that how Buffett made his billions?). And it is not hard to be a committed buy and holder when the Dow is fast approaching 7000. Buy and hold has been very profitable and almost any fool could play.But it has not always been so. Sustained bear markets do exist. And in a bear market the mugs in mutual funds become more than passingly skittish. Buy and hold was once unfashionable and it will be again. This is a book (first published in 1934) from the period where buy and hold was as deeply unfashionable as it has been any time in history. Loeb is an extreme pesimist. If the Dow ever sees 4000 again he might become popular.Loeb does not think that fundamental analysis makes any sense. He illustrates with companies which have been overvalued for years at a time and with companies where persistent undervaluation has occured.Loeb does not believe in buying good stocks and holding them. Though buying good stocks before events likely to cause revaluation might be a good idea.Loeb does not believe in diversification. A diversified portfolio will get beaten around in a bear market just as surely as an undiversified one. Moreover, a diversified portfolio will reduce the attention you can pay to individual stocks. Loeb advocates putting all your eggs in one basket and taking extra care to watch the basket.Loeb thinks that if you do not know what to do you should be in cash or near equivalents (short dated high quality paper). If you are in stocks you are in for a hiding.Loeb believes in firm (and irrevocable) stop loss rules. If you buy a good stock and it goes down sell it. Buy and holders might just be inclined to buy some more and suffer more damage at the hands of capricious bears.That these views are deeply unfashionable comes as no surprise when the buy and holders have had such a good run. I come from Australia where the index peaked at 2310 in October 1987 and has only just broken 2400. It spent years in the 1200-1500 range. New Zealand has never broken the pre-crash levels. These are markets where the general populace is scared of stocks. Mutual fund madness is unknown here. I know no Australian who invests in mutuals.I do not think that Loeb is right. But he knows a few things that very few people do know in the US market. Maybe that makes them worth knowing.This is a book about the psychology of a sustained bear market. Dow investors will not recognise it. It is more familiar to us in the Antipodes. Read it so that you will recognise it. And when everyone you know is thinking like Loeb, and the baby boomers have become 'mutual shy', pull out Graham and the other buy and hold bibles and go shopping on Wall Street.",Business & Economics

And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...""Jane Eyre"" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (""She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart""). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being ""passionate,"" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, ""Jane Eyre"" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read.",Literary Criticism

1568959443,In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex,,A1QKAYYCZMITVM,dana haggett,1/1,4.0,968284800,A Perfect Wreck,"In The Heart of The Sea is more than just the tale of a chilling tragedy, perseverance, and suffering. Like The Hungry Ocean, the Linda Greenlaw book on sword fishing, Heart of the Sea gives you a fair understanding of the traveling Nantucket factories that were the whale ships of the early 19th century.Philbrick reconstructs Quaker Nantucket society, whaling operations, and American's knowledge of their world, creating a context for the decisions and actions the men in the whaleship took. While we may be horrified at the lengths the crew went to for survival, it does force the question upon the reader.It's amazing what people can survive. After 93 days asea after the wreck, these men (some of them, anyway, or all of them in a way) went home, plumped up a bit, and went right back out to sea again.For those squeamish about familial cannibalism, whale slaughter, and mindless cruelty to tortoises, this is one to avoid.",History
B000PBZH6Q,Foundation,,A31DIT4W29RVS5,Antinomian,5/5,5.0,1134345600,On the Original Foundation Series (Trilogy),"The original Foundation series was released as a series of three books: Foundation, Foundation & Empire, and Second Foundation, in 1951, 1952, and 1953, respectively. Some datedness to this series is to be expected, but I've read SF stories written 40 years after these that felt more dated, and personally I think the concept, the sweeping distant future galactic empire Asimov writes, far outweighs any datedness one might expect. So much so, that for serious science fiction readers this series is almost essential reading. Not essential in that you *have to*, nothing kills interest faster than making it some classroom prerequisite to SF, but more in that it would be hard to consider that you wouldn't find some aspect of this series worthwhile at least and absolutely fascinating at best. Several reviewers had said that this trilogy is really a series of shorter novellas that were published earlier thus leading to some incohesiveness. Until a few days ago, I wasn't aware of that and when I read this series and discussed with friends afterwards that never came up. This is a sweeping series, where if an *only* 1000 year dark age is the *best* case scenario, you realize that a lot of time may have to be covered leading to chronological jumps.The idea of psychohistory is a fascinating concept and I haven't seen anyone else really copy it. With that said, it could also be considered a far fetched concept. To predict the history of a huge civilization statistically, albeit in large numbers to offset individuality, but still made up the most irrational entities in the known universe, human beings, is pushing credibility. But that's what also makes this a powerful concept as well. This idea has also been considered in the United States, for what else, economic theory. Statistically there had been too many variables, basically risk. Then in the 80's some economic theorists came upon the concept of eliminating the variable of risk, by forming a mutual fund of as many diverse economic sources as possible. The more the better (like Seldon's the larger the group of people the better) because any worldwide effect causing one economic segment to go down would be offset by some other economic segment that wouldn't. This concept was considered revolutionary and massive amounts of money were poured into this mutual fund from numerous financial institutions. And it worked and paid off well... for a while. But like the Mule of the book series, the theory couldn't account for a single element that would take a large segment of the economy with it. In this case, it was the financial meltdown of the Asian economy that was so sweeping, it took down so many markets that this mutual fund plummeted. So many institutions had poured money into the fund that the US government actually had to help bail it out, because it's collapse threatened the US economy and possibly the entire world economy. (PBS did a fascinating documentary on the events.) So the theory of psychohistory is difficult to consider viable, but is still a fascinating theory and the inventor of it in the series, Hari Seldon, is the Albert Einstein of the empire and is successful at it. Until, that is, a powerful individual comes along, The Mule, which the theory cannot account for and the Seldon Plan fails. The Seldon Plan is so visionary at first that every once in a while long after his death, a prerecorded holographic speech of Seldon would occur stating would should be occurring in the universe at that time and indeed it is occurring. The Foundation realizes they're in big trouble when, after the emergence of The Mule, Seldon returns in one of his recorded messages and the events of the time isn't what he predicted. Asimov writes this section brilliantly.Thus Seldon had secretly instituted a Second Foundation (which is essentially a Backup Plan). I cannot call myself an Asimov fan. I don't really care for his robot series in general and the endings of Asimov's novels tend to be anticlimactic. But with the Foundation series he turns this into an advantage. The final book of the series deals with the confrontation with the Second Foundation. By this time the reader is aware of the power of the Second Foundation and thus the confrontation doesn't need to be with laser pistol or light saber, and is over in minutes. What a brilliant conclusion.I've considered the original Foundation trilogy a stand-alone series. Asimov's Foundations Edge, written 30 years later, is different as to be expected. Since the Foundation series was sufficiently concluded (and stood for 30 years), Foundation's Edge has to add a new element and I've always mentally considered it the Third Foundation. The entire Foundation series is now a seven book series (septology?) and some might say that the post-trilogy novels have corrupted the original series. If you decide to read on, Foundation's Edge is a good book, and did win the 1983 Hugo Award, deservedly so, it helps to keep in mind the real-world chronological differences between the two.",Education

The rich irony about the lengths that men strive to acquire property in all its forms and then find their acquisitions useless, meaningless and certainly not worth the price. Galworthy was focused upon property in so many different varieties: the sense of possession that men had of their wives in his time amid archaic laws about divorce; the building of a home that ends in unexpected expense in chancery; the elusive value of works of art; the subtleties of property from family crests, clubs, colleges and occupational status and cuts of mutton to the blatant futility of fighting over land in South Africa during the Boer War -- it's all shallow and empty materialism in the end. The property is never worth the cost of the trouble to acquire it. Young people slave to gather possessions only to regret in old age that they have traded so much of life away to gain them and must undergo the painful rigors of its redistribution through wills after death. Galsworthy seemed to me like a sort of British Tolstoy writing in England for property reform. Because when property is involved, men tend to objectify about it and in the course of things they tend to lose their sense of humanity. This troublesome pattern of life seems to repeat itself often like a lesson men never learn -- as the objectifying I-It relationship of Martin Buber replaces the humane I-Thou. Yes, it's a long novel but when the writing is this compelling in its style and substance, you can luxuriate in the beauty and wisdom of the words. Every character is finely and individually drawn like a character in a Velasquez portrait of a large family. You may regret that this edition isn't longer when it ends but fortunately there is more of his work in which to indulge. Galsworthy's work earned him a Nobel Prize -- it's easy to see the astonishing depth and range and virtuosity that the Nobel judges found in his writing. Don't pass up the chance to bask in this epic saga of Galsworthy. It's easily one of the top ten novels ever written in the English language -- it's really that good.",Fiction

B00072T41W,General chemistry,,A258HDMERSI6WJ,Michael Wischmeyer,5/5,4.0,1045180800,"Good Examples, Good Illustrations, Great for Self-Study","I have not seriously looked at a chemistry textbook in years. I still recall with some unease my classes in inorganic chemistry, organic chemistry, biochemistry, geochemistry, and physical chemistry. Despite our long hours together, chemistry and I were never close friends.A while back I found myself browsing ""General Chemistry"", a widely used text authored by P. W. Atkins and J. A. Beran. Surprisingly, I transitioned from a cursory review mode to a dedicated reading of the entire text. I emerged six months later with an excitment for chemistry that I had never developed while attending university.Like most first year college science textbooks, the latest edition of Atkins' text is thick (about 1,000 glossy pages), heavy, and incredibly expensive. I used an older second edition (1990) that is available for a substantially reduced price on Amazon.I suspect that Atkins' text is more detailed than many first year chemistry books. I found the section on Redox Equations and Half Reactions to be troublesome. I had difficulty with chapters 14 and 15 on Acids and Bases (pgs. 531-620) and even set the book aside for several weeks. I am unsure whether the problem was with the text or with me, probably a little of both. The last 300 pages seemed easier going. The organic chemistry sections were well written.I appreciated the way that the authors clearly explained the solution strategy for ALL example problems before detailing the solution itself. The problem is defined, a strategy for solving the problem is discussed, and the solution is clearly shown. This feature makes Atkins' textbook particularly sutiable for self-study and review.I especially enjoyed the discussions on special topics like Processing Ores, Scanning Tunneling Microscope, Redox Reactions in Photography, Photoelectrochemistry, Swimming Pool Chemistry, Stalactite Growth, and Smog Formation.I am puzzled why reader reviews for Atkins' various textbooks seem so inconsistent. Some readers rave about his textbooks; others hate them. I have read this book from cover to cover and I join those readers that recommend Atkins' textbooks.Recently I came across a more current edition of Atkins' General Chemistry (now co-authoed with Loretta Jones) that has been substantially restructured. The new 3D drawings of molecules were especially impressive. If you can afford it, buy a newer edition, but avoid the high cost of the latest edition unless it is a class requirement.",Science

This is the first study to look in detail at the monthly budgets of welfare recipients. The authors show that welfare payments consistently fall short of the monthly needs of mothers and their children, with the shortfalls being worst among employed mothers (because of the additional expenses incurred for clothes, transportation, child care, and the reductions in benefits associated with work). They show that mothers use a variety of strategies to ""make ends meet,"" combining various alternate sources of income, including unreported gifts from boyfriends and childrens' fathers; unreported income from informal jobs like babysitting and housecleaning; and illegal income from criminal activities like occasional prostitution and drug dealing. The authors highlight the (then-current) welfare rules that made it extremely difficult to get by without breaking the rules or the law, and they neither endorse nor condemn these activities, but they do make a number of policy suggestions.Welfare rules have changed considerably over the past 15 years, rendering ""Making Ends Meet"" somewhat out of date. The changes that most affect the ability of recipients to make ends meet are those that reduce the costs and benefits of employment by subsidizing child care, health care, transportation and clothes, and by reducing the proportion of wages that employed recipients must pay back to the welfare agency. Still, most of the difficulties of survival on welfare likely remain much the same as they were in the mid-1990s.",Social Science
B000PBZH6Q,Foundation,,A2B9Y0WXNSN17U,doomsdayer520,1/1,4.0,1028160000,Slightly Problematic Second Installment of the Trilogy,"The classic Foundation trilogy continues on pace in this second installment. The first half of this book is rather flat with uninspiring political wrangles and a story of the Empire's last general who is defeated by the Foundation and is never mentioned again. This episode has little effect on the overall flow of the story and is a curious piece of filler in this otherwise strong trilogy. However, the second half of this book, taking place many decades later, more than makes up for it. Here we learn that Hari Seldon's once flawless predictions on the course of humanity throughout the galaxy are starting to break down, because of the passage of huge amounts of time and the introduction of an unforeseen variable. This variable is a mutant known as The Mule, who has strange mental powers that are outside the realm of Seldon's psychohistory and throw his ancient predictions out of whack. Soon both the Foundation and the Empire are in ruins, and barbarism reigns throughout the galaxy. Only the mysterious Second Foundation, which has not been heard from since Seldon's day, can possibly help. Whether or not the Second Foundation can save the galaxy from the dark ages, and whether this is all really a part of Seldon's plan after all, are questions that arise in this book but are not answered. Thus we have an excellent intellectual cliffhanger that gives a great reason to continue to the third installment of the trilogy.There are two strange occurrences in this book that speak volumes on the time period in which Asimov wrote it, that being the 1940's. First, there is a prominent female character in this book, which was nearly unheard of in the sci-fi of that area. Furthermore, Asimov writes as if this is an amazing occurrence, and other characters are shocked and uncomfortable with this woman's status as an ""equal"" among the male characters around her. This sure seems strange today. Was Asimov slyly commenting on the state of women's rights back in mid-century, or did he think he was making a grand statement about the future? Either way, the sentiment is oddly outdated and even more oddly takes place in the distant future of humanity, where I would hope things would have progressed. Finally, in the second-to-last line of the book, Asimov inserts a rather sick dirty joke through the use of a sly double entendre (the key word is ""mule"").. Back in 1952 Asimov probably thought he was making a goofy in-joke to his learned friends that would not be caught by the general public. If that's the case, the joke in question seems extremely silly and predictable today, and brings the book to a close that is rather difficult to take seriously.",Education

A worthy and needed updating of the first edition. Now this paperback edition is made available. The cheaper cost will benefit some readers. Its reputation as one of the standard unix texts means that many unix and linux programmers need it in their workplace. But possibly the cost of the hardcover version was a deterrent.Meanwhile, I reproduce my review of the second edition, hardcover, from 2005, below. My remarks in it still stand.===========================Many of you who learnt unix in the 90s would have cut your teeth on the first edition of this book. This second edition should be well received. It encapsulates the changes in the unix world since 92. Most importantly, it shows the rise of linux. A rise that is still unabated.Broadly, the structure of this edition matches the first edition. Rago was brought in as co-author after Stevens died in 99, and he has deliberately kept this consistency. I was glad to see that Rago kept the exercises at the end of each chapter. Many computer books seem to dispense with this, which can be a pity for anyone who needs hands on tasks to learn from.The threading chapters are a significant change from the first edition. Not simple reading, but they do reflect powerful ways to possibly optimise your code. The biggest cost for you may be the effort you need to invest in understanding the coding issues in these chapters. Rago's code examples are deliberately short, and necessarily somewhat artificial. But they do demonstrate well the various threading issues.Of course, other chapters have had minimal alterations. How much have terminal I/O or pseudoterminals changed in 10 years? Those chapters may be old friends to you.",Computers

I refused to be defeated and knew there must be a book out there that would help me make good bread (with the machine that I had begged for). THIS is the book!I read all the reviews that precede 2002 and got the book right away. I love the way Hensperger explains ingredients, the science of bread and how the machine works.

For some reason, if I do it Hensperger's way, I always have to add more flour. So, I just scoop it without aerating the flour first.Another review mentioned that you &quot;have to&quot; use SAF yeast. I haven't found this to be true. I have used the SAF, but have also used fast-acting and bread machine yeast. Both have turned out fine.

Although Soames is supposed to be the enemy--cold, forbidding, and capable of raping his own wife to claim his &quot;rights as a husband,&quot; nevertheless, I have always felt sorry for him, especially in this reading. Would he have been a different man if Irene could have loved him back? Would he have softened, become more human, more able to feel happiness? In later books, he is loved back by his only daughter Fleur (by his second wife), but by then he is too set in his ways to change.And Irene...the modern-day Helen of Troy. The beauty who breaks men's hearts without even knowing it...could she help being so terribly cold to Soames? With her warm, loving nature, could she possibly have found it in herself to love her exact opposite? That dilemma continues through the generations to culminate in a truly intense tragedy involving Irene's only son and Soames' only daughter.I am so glad to have revisited this book once again and seeing it with new eyes. It is so much more than a mere melodrama, and the quality of Galsworthy's writing is much more talented than I had ever realized. The Forsyte Saga should be included among the masterpieces of a certain era. It has the universal truth and staying power that is deserving of status as a true classic.",Fiction

This book explains his break with Buddhism and conversion to Catholicism. It reads like a series of disconnected meditations - some more intellectually hefty than others - on the whole matter.It seems he was very much a philosophical Buddhist, and not a devotional one - though he has interesting things to say about the Pure Land Buddhism of Shinran. He lands some blows against Buddhism, carefully criticising its incoherent view of reincarnation, its pessimism, and its lack of hope for the believer. His comments on Buddhism are fascinating, and will be of interest to both friends and foes of Buddhism.Less so, his longer remarks on Catholicism. In brief, he's an expert on Buddhism, but very much an amateur at western philosophy and theology. I don't think he'd disagree. But with the zeal of a new convert or a newlywed, he's pretty unimpressed by the considerable difficulties of Catholic doctrine. While he skewers Buddhism on personal identity and life after death, he crows about the ""magic and mystery"" of Catholic doctrines like transubstantiation, the incarnation, and the Trinity. And he's a very, very Catholic Christian. With the slight exception of Anglicanism, he can't muster a shard of sympathy for any Protestant approach to Christian thought and life. Still, the book is a good read. It's the story of a man discovering the deep appeal of theism, and of Christianity, in parts, told in endearingly personal terms.",Religion

B000PBZH6Q,Foundation,,A4UL27HNJL88T,Murnert,5/5,3.0,1296000000,"Entertaining, but...","The key to enjoying the original Foundation trilogy is to understand that the three novels which make up the ""trilogy"" are not really novels. They are a series of interconnected stories written over time. Foundation is actually 5 short stories. Because of this the stories vary in quality.The second book, Foundation and Empire is actually two stories. The first is called The General, and tells the story of the empire's last ditch effort to conquer the foundation. The weakness of the first story is that all the action takes place off page. We never see any of the actual combat, we just read the characters talking about it. Also, the resolution comes way too quickly. It feels like Asimov had reached his page limit and decided to end the story as quickly as he could.The second story, called The Mule, is the real draw here. All the previous stories presented a challege for the foundation to overcome. However, it was always expected that the foundation would triumph based on the long term scientific predictions of its founder. The Mule throws in a variable that was not predicted. The appearance of a mutant who swiftly moves to conquer the various planets left in the wake of the old empire's collapse. Ultimately, he sets his sights on the foundation. The best part of the story is a visit to the ruins of the planet Trantor. Former capital of the galactic empire.Having finished this second book, I have come to realize that the Foundation trilogy, while entertaining is certainly not Asimov's best work. Time is not always kind to science fiction and all of these early stories were written before 1950, when Asimov was still a young writer. I plan to continue on to the next book, but I no longer expect to be overwhelmed by the classic status these stories have achieved.",Education

I didn't think that the book was quite as good as its reputation, however.It is easy to see why The Long Season made such a strong impression when it was published in 1960. Brosnan's account of the 1959 baseball season was one of the first books that didn't ""sugarcoat"" the professional athlete's life. Brosnan is very opinionated about baseball and the characters in the baseball world.I don't think that the book has aged that well, however. It doesn't have the irreverence or gossipy tone of books that followed, such as Ball Four. I found, therefore, that the book could be slow going in places. You do get an excellent view of the 1959-era baseball world, however.In summary, The Long Season is a good read for those who want to know more about baseball 50 years ago.

Whitty ""Kevin Whitty""",2/2,5.0,1048291200,Excellent book - in spite of the poor English,"The ""reforms"" which many believe to have been initiated by Vatican II are not actually reforms but rebellions, and some of the rebellions mentioned in this book are incredible (a woman dressed in an alb and stole ""concelebrating"" a Holy Mass and even hearing confessions!).Priests, bishops, and even some cardinals have rejected the authority of Rome in favor of their own view of what true Catholic worship should be. The result has been a departure from the vertical worship of true liturgy to the horizontal worship of modernism, indifferentism, Americanism, and naturalism. Naturally this departure does not only manifest itself in liturgical abuses, but also in doctrinal abuses (contradicting the Church's stand on birth control, homosexuality, abortion; preaching heresy from the pulpit; inviting blatantly anti-Catholic speakers to speak at Catholic retreats and seminars).The book gives the best possible advice for those who really want to understand why the quality of our liturgy has declined so terribly in the last few decades; read the Bible, the Catechism, the Vatican II conciliar documents, and the Code of Canon Law; confront (respectfully) the priests who are committing liturgical abuses (I say respectfully because some of them are heretics, while others may truly not know that something they are doing is actually an abuse); confront the bishop; and if necessary, write the Vatican.I give this book five stars.

Only later were the stories combined as a book. That is why of course no great character development occurs and the stories seem tidbits rather than grand scale work. Granted there is not much science in the book, but I have always felt that sci-fi is a form of fiction to allow the author to write freely on a subject and be able to mask what he is really talking about. Think about it, change the story to another world and have strange names for planets and suddenly nobody sees it as an attack against their country or their people. I have also felt science fiction to be more political than science (even though we call it science fiction). Politics are immense in Foundation and the style of having conversations to tell the story vs. having lots of action and space battles is fantastic. I read this first when I was 18 and did not appreciate what Asimov is trying to do. At 39, I get it. Asimov is looking at society in general and commenting that no society can be perfect and ideal and all wonderful and that dirty tricks and greed and compromise and working with others (including our enemies) is the only way a society can survive and the rest is simply propaganda. It's a direct attack against all societies that foster the idea that we're the best and the greatest and we stand for freedoms and love of country. Instead he states that what all societies become are survivors finding their strengths to counteract the enemies weaknesses. It's a great reality check which is why this should be required reading for all political science majors.",Education

B0007E2ADE,"Technical analysis of stock trends,",,A2211DYUNQXPK7,"Mike Carr, CMT",26/28,5.0,1177718400,"Not just updated, completely new and must have...","If Edwards and Magee wrote the bible of technical analysis in 1948 when they first published ""Technical Analysis of Stock Trends."" then why do we need a Ninth Edition of their classic? This question was foremost in my mind as I began reading this recently released version of a book I spent many hours with as I prepared for the CMT exams. After reading all 832 pages, I realized that in many ways, the financial markets, and technical analysis, are finally maturing to the point where we can fully grasp the significance of what was first written almost sixty years ago. With a focus on pragmatic portfolio theory, editor Charles Bassetti significantly contributes to the technical analysis body of knowledge especially related to tactics, and has created a book worth a space on every technician's bookshelf.In this edition, Bassetti delivers much more than an update - it's actually a new book. He focuses on strategies for increasing profits:* The basics of traditional chart analysis are clearly presented, just as Robert Edwards meant for them to be. In keeping with the practice of earlier editions, Bassetti retains the original charts showing examples of patterns from the 1940s and earlier. He also includes more than two dozen new charts, demonstrating that the same old patterns still work today. The detailed discussion of the market psychology that forms these patterns may stimulate modern analysts to program the patterns.* Adds a comprehensive explanation of Magee's ""basing points"" procedure for setting initial and trailing stops on any position. Bassetti adds a chapter and charts to clarify this powerful concept, which in itself is worth more than the cost of the book.* For what may be the first time, Bassetti provides an annotated chart of the Dow, combining an in-depth discussion of Dow Theory with a visual history of the signals. We've all seen tables showing the sell signal in Oct 1929 or the buy signal in late-1990 which lasted more than seven years, but the chart erases any doubt that Dow Theory is a valuable timing tool. Creating a comprehensive source on the Dow Theory, he also includes an overview of Robert Colby's method to automate the signals.* Provides a link to www.edwards-magee.com, which offers downloadable material that supplements the text. As one example, readers can download pdf files of the Dow Theory signals for closer examination.* Offers new perspectives on short-term and futures trading. The extensive new material on commodity trading, including a complete trading plan, was not addressed in previous editions.Bassetti also ensures the reader understands the similarities between Magee's Sensitivity Index and Modern Portfolio Theory's Beta; and the striking resemblance of Magee's Composite Leverage to the financial engineering concept of Value at Risk. Readers of previous editions may not have realized that Magee developed these concepts decades before Nobel Prize-winning work was undertaken in these areas. Magee wrote in the language of the trader (semi-log charts), rather than the academician and his ideas have been overlooked by economic theorists.A classic book is one that stands the test of time. No one can argue that Technical Analysis of Stock Trends fails in this regard. Patterns that worked a hundred years ago are still found in financial markets and they still work. The forecasting ability of patterns lies in their ability to document the history of human nature, which remains unchanged over many centuries.Another feature of classic works is a unique style. Edwards and Magee filled their work with examples - current at the time of publication. They wrote with clarity and ease of style not usually found in textbooks. Their text was a practical ""how to"" manual that explained the ""study of the action of the market itself"" in concrete terms. It appealed to those seeking the Holy Grail on Wall Street, and to those serious students of the markets seeking an edge. In this new edition, Bassetti retains all of their style and introduces his own, which in all ways is similar to the original, but with a modern edge.Bassetti believes that Magee's concept of basing points is worth a great deal of additional study. This is one of the most significant contributions he makes to the new edition, updating this section in the tactics to ensure that all traders understand this method of stop placement. His example is clear, and the reader can instantly implement this technique, which Bassetti thinks of as one of the most valuable in the book.Some question whether classical chart reading is still a valid discipline in an era defined by cheap data, powerful scanning and backtesting software, instantaneous execution and quantitative analysis. After reading this book, you'll be left with a deeper appreciation of the value of chart reading and will become an even stronger proponent of technical analysis in modern markets.",Business & Economics

B0007EI15A,The Battle for Investment Survival,,A3QQLPR8R87ONM,eqtbooks,0/0,5.0,1357948800,In constant demand from traders,"Gerald Loeb was a well-known Wall Street profile for over 40 years. As a partner of the investment bank E.F. Hutton he broked stocks, but more importantly, he invested his own and other investors money. On top of all, he wrote popular columns in Barron's and Wall Street Today about his investment strategies and how they kept him out of the market mayhem in 1929 to 1932. As Loeb had become somewhat of a celebrity by the time this book was released it was an instant hit. It has been in constant demand from traders henceforth with reprint after reprint.Two years into Loeb's career and just when he had started to manage clients' money, the crash of 1923 wiped out most of the funds he had responsibility for. The losses and the apparent riskiness of stocks affected the young Loeb deeply and formed the investment philosophy he used going forward. In a stock market where you have to ""fight for your survival"" Loeb advised to only invest in the strongest leadership stock in upwards trending markets. If the market trend is down, stay in cash. If you are unsure if the trend is up or down, stay in cash. ""The way to build long-term returns is through preservation of capital and home runs.""Loeb's book came out at about the same time that Ben Graham's Security Analysis was released and in some ways it is the antithesis of Graham's teachings. Loeb is almost agitational when it comes to valuation multiples. Intrinsic values might exist, or they might not, but while waiting for the market to, at some time in the distant future, accommodate your view of this highly uncertain value the investment was exposed to the whims of the market. For Loeb this was an invitation for disaster. I think what Loeb is really arguing against is a buy-and-hold-strategy rather than a value strategy per se. Given his 1923 experience and the vindication he received in 1929/32 this is no wonder. I also think the approach is highly relevant today. The market has historically moved in 15 to 20 year-long valuation driven cycles. Right now we are in a phase where the secular trend is sideways, with violent cyclical swings. Hence the risk of not being fully invested in the stock market at all times is low. In a few years from now the market will have grown into its valuation and then the risk of not being fully invested will be high. Hence, today is not the time to be a buy-and-holder, but in a few years it might be.For anyone who has read a more modern day text on trend following or trading, most of the advice Loeb gives will be very familiar. This is no surprise since this is one of the creeds for all the later books. Loeb searched for a combination of roughly 5 - often cyclical - companies at the time with leadership positions in their line of business, with strong corporate financials and where the trend of the stock and the trading volume was favourable. He only bought stocks where the potential was massive or else the risk was that the investment would turn sour. He wrote down the ""single ruling reason"" for his investment and reviewed the investments after they have been terminated. Further, Loeb cut losses short and rode his winners. He advised to understand the psychology of the crowd but try not to join it. Timeless advice.In its original 1935 edition the book had 33 chapters of 3 to 4 pages each. In the later 1965 edition another 45 similar sized chapters consisting of miscellaneous articles was added. Given that the organization of the original book is non-existent the randomness of the topics in the added chapters doesn't change the character of the book - the text is confusing, repetitive and un-organized. The reading experience is saved by Loeb's passion, deep market insight and real life examples. There are plenty of nuggets here but you have to dig hard for them.There are few other books where the author is as in sync with the market. Loeb isn't handing us his insights on a plate but there is plenty there for those who are ready to do the work.This is a review by eqtbooks.com",Business & Economics

Perhaps Feather and Hentoff are better at providing some of the first-hand personal information that helps a reader join the music to the musician, the musician to the human being. The making of this music does not come without great physical risks and costs, and it's always fascinated me how jazz artists have come to terms and compensated for weakened chops (Diz), altered timbre (Sarah), or a foreclosing mortage on one's time (Duke).

087154234X,Making Ends Meet: How Single Mothers Survive Welfare and Low-Wage Work,19.2,A1S0TB8S4Y7CIQ,Nicholas Stix,5/20,3.0,1058140800,Who'll Stop the Rain?,"3 1/2 starsDuring the early 1980s, social scientists noticed that welfare mothers were spending three to six times their official incomes. In his exquisitely written foreword, Harvard sociologist Christopher Jencks argues persuasively that in a ""conspiracy of silence,"" conservatives didn't want to admit that mothers could not survive on welfare checks alone, while ""liberals"" didn't want to admit that clients had unreported resources. Jencks and his colleagues asked where the additional money was coming from. Making Ends Meet provides some answers.Aided by over thirty research associates, sociologist Kathryn Edin and anthropologist Laura Lein interviewed 379 single welfare AND poor working mothers in Chicago, Boston, San Antonio, Charleston and rural Minnesota. The authors compared the groups, with the purpose of undermining welfare reform.Virtually all of the mothers studied derived income from their children's fathers, from boyfriends, relatives, off-the-books jobs (e.g., babysitting), selling stolen goods, prostitution or dealing drugs. Despite unreported income, uneducated, unskilled women working at ""dead-end"" jobs were barely treading water.The authors report that single, working mothers have more cash, yet suffer greater hardships than their non-working counterparts. Working mothers must pay for additional transportation, and for services such as medical and child care that welfare mothers get free. Edin and Lein thus conclude that poor women are usually worse off working than being on welfare.The authors tend to exaggerate the difficulty of finding affordable child care. Although a respondent told of getting babysitting services from a welfare mother for a bag or two of groceries per month, the authors speak of ""market-rate"" (read: exorbitant, state-licensed) child care. As NYU political scientist Lawrence Mead noted in The New Politics of Poverty (1992), as Jencks corroborates, and as I know from direct experience, poor working mothers are able to negotiate affordable, unlicensed child care without ""service-providers"" from inflationary, government programs. The supposed lack of child care is a rehearsed response that welfare mothers know to give to credulous, ""Suzy the social worker"" (a term a foster-care caseworker colleague taught me) types and socialist/radical multicultural academic researchers: ""I really want to work, but ...""Edin and Lein alternate between the role of ""Suzies"" and that of dogged interviewers. They re-interview respondents who initially gave unrealistic budgets, or ambiguous or misleading answers on whether they were receiving child support, or engaging in casual prostitution. The pervasiveness of casual prostitution matched my own observations in New York's slums; that of informal child support surprised me. However, when it comes to the mothers' rationalizations for not working, it's ""Suzy time"" again. The conflicted authors emphasize mothers' concern with avoiding criminal activity, despite chronicling their involvement in prostitution, and in contracting with shoplifters to steal clothing for their children.Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty, and the Democrats' ensuing Northern Strategy's revolutionary anti-morality put dunce caps on millennia-old moral teachings prohibiting premarital sex. Armies of sexual ""educators"" and ""helping"" professionals and their university and media apologists told girls they had a right to ""non-marital births,"" and demanded that hardworking, married folks support those children. Implicitly re-defining a family as an unwed mother and child(ren), the authors are shocked, shocked, that this results in a poor, unskilled girl raising her fatherless child(ren) in poverty.(As liberal Democratic historian Fred Siegel (The Future Once Happened Here) has chronicled, the Marxist National Welfare Rights Organization (NWRO) sought to bankrupt New York City, and precipitate a revolution. From 1966-73, liberal Republican Mayor John V. Lindsay's social services commissioner, Mitchell ""Come and Get It"" Ginsberg, more than doubled the welfare rolls, from 538,000 to 1.165 million. At the same time, the NWRO pursued a politics of racial polarization, a politics it later attributed to Republicans. Instead of a revolution, the NWRO precipitated the moral collapse of urban black society.)In seeing life in ""some of the country's most dangerous neighborhoods"" as driving concerned mothers onto the dole, rather than leave their children unsupervised while they work, the authors confuse cause and effect. It is the spread of illegitimacy and welfare, and their accompanying vices, that has made such areas so dangerous.In Why Nothing Works (1987), ""liberal"" anthropologist Marvin Harris ""explained"" that welfare clients raised their sons to be violent, the better to protect the mothers (from other women's sons). Hence, to the degree that poor young blacks and Hispanics embrace crime, they do so not in response to (white) racism, or lack of opportunity, but to their rearing.Millions of American couples avoid poverty through pooling modest paychecks, one spouse working extra hours, sharing responsibilities, relying on relatives for child care and limiting their wants. The authors have unwittingly made a compelling case for demolishing the welfare state and its ""alternative"" family models. The solution is marriage.When I was a foster-care caseworker, one of my clients almost always missed agency visits to see her seven children. ""I didn't want to leave the house, 'cause it was rainin,'"" gradually became ""It looked like it MIGHT rain."" Edin and Lein deny the morality of work and responsible living, yet portray welfare clients as always a government program away from employability. But government will never be able to stop the rain, just as it will never be able to guarantee uneducated, unskilled women ""good jobs.""I doubt that Making Ends Meet will cause an uncommitted reader to suddenly empathize with welfare clients. In a New York Times puff piece, Edin inadvertently clarified the book's (for me) peculiar sensibility. Reporter Jason DeParle related that while Edin, who is white, found black children beautiful, ""white children at times began to look 'homely'"" to her. Rather than caring about ALL poor kids, Kathryn Edin apparently feels a blind loyalty to poor black women and their children, and a corresponding obligation to be repelled by children of her own race.

It's a world motivated by keeping up appearances and exercising the strictest control over expression of one's emotions -- that is, if one is to preserve one's status as a proper member of the upper middleclass. Indeed, the only safe emotion is curiosity about how much others have paid for their possessions and whether they are to be congratulated or envied for acquiring something for nothing, or shall they be sneered at and ridiculed for having paid more. The Forsytes are a commercial bunch, everything boils down to financial value for them -- even relationships bear price tags.Old Jolyon is patriarch of the Forsyte clan. Unlike his brothers, he is now scornful of that middleclass ethos they so highly value, often to their detriment. Old Jolyon has lived long enough to regret his deference to appearances, which had cost him his relationship with his only son.The author's indictment against the stern, uncharitable principles cherished by the British upper middleclass is peppered throughout the narration, the characters always replacing any thoughts toward generosity with sound justification (read: excuse) for niggardly self interest. We are used to categorizing characters as victims, villains and heroes. However, in this story it can be argued that everyone is a victim; there are no real heroes or real villains. Because of his unsympathetic nature, cousin Soames might appear a villain, but truly he is as tragic a figure as Mr. Bosinney (the fiance of June, Old Jolyon's granddaughter) who is in love with the tragically beautiful Irene, Soames's wife. Although the reader is generously privy to the thoughts and feelings of the members of the clan, including disagreeable inlaws, it is noteworthy that the reader is only aware of the two tragic characters, Bosinney and Irene, as they are observed by others. The author never allows the reader to trespass directly into their souls to expose all therein. Fortunately for us, these two wear their hearts on their sleeves and others are thereby enabled to read volumes simply by taking advantage of brief observations. We see the reactions of Irene and Bosinney, never their internal motivations.The title of this book begs the question, exactly who is the man of property or to which man of property does the title refer -- and what exactly is the property that is referenced. Ultimately cousin Soames is the man specifically identified in the title, and surely the property particularly stressed is his unyielding wife, the incomparable Irene. Irene is so much the sophisticated lady, so beguiling in appearance and manner, I am reminded of Jane Austen's ""dear Jane Fairfax"" (""Emma"") who, like dear Irene, has no money of her own and therefore is compelled to select between the lesser of two (or more) quite unattractive situations. For certainly, when one's station is so reduced, being without the means to _choose_ between this pleasant possibility and that pleasant circumstance, one simply must _decide_ which evil will produce the least harm. In The Man of Property, everyone is selecting -- sometimes their choices backfire and then they must decide the next step. June happily _chose_ to become engaged to marry Bosinney, but later she has to _decide_ how best to keep him or even whether she is at all capable of keeping him.Bosinney also brings to mind another brooding young man from literature -- Mr. Ladislaw of George Eliot's ""Middlemarch"", who also was tragically in love with another man's wife. Indeed, when reading the description of Bosinney's high cheek bones, casual manners and the intensity of his emotions, one might be tempted to cast the actor Rufus Sewell in that role; for Sewell's portrayal of Ladislaw was quite memorable in the Masterpiece Theatre television adaptation of ""Middlemarch"", another story about keeping up appearances and making happy choices or miserable decisions.The Man of Property moves along very quickly. The author's descriptions of the lifestyle and environment of that time are quite detailed. But for the selfish and unpleasant people who populate this world, the sensitive reader might easily drift into this other time and other place, which for this reader is the mark of a truly rich literary experience.",Fiction

Of 70 reviews only three of the reviews said that the advice in the book lead to a better relationship versus two reviews that said the advice ruined a good relationship. The advice is just an updated version of advice for `women that love too much' that was popular 20 years ago, and that advice was nothing more than retooled divisive feminist demagoguery. Even though the book is about 250 pages long, it could be cooked down to two sentences:1. Good girls are clingy, needy doormats that men only use before moving on.2. Bitches, empowered and put themselves number one, are what men desire.The alleged humor is nothing more than updated feminist humor. Of course you remember feminist humor:Don't imagine you can change a man - unless he is in diapers.What do you if your boyfriend walks out? You shut the door.If they can send a man to the moon - why can't they send them all?Never let your man's mind wander - it's too little to be out alone.In a few years this book will be another thing that women who followed the advice will be trying to sweep under the carpet and pretend it never happened while they are making up yet another self-deluding reason why men do not like them.For those women that have not yet had enough of being lied to, manipulated and used by people with dubious claims backed by thinly disguised advocacy research, then this book is for you. For those women that have had enough of reinventing themselves and truly want to change their lives, then this book is not part of the solution; it is part of the problem.---------------------------------------------------------The more I see of the new fangled way of doing things, the more I appreciate the old fangled way of doing things.",Family & Relationships

B0007EI15A,The Battle for Investment Survival,,A6UVUAK8022I0,J. Martin,24/26,2.0,1265068800,The book is truly challenging!,"The Battle for Investment SurvivalHailed as a must-read classic, I decided to pick up a copy. Having first been published in 1935, I wondered just how relevant its teachings are today (the copy I read was from 1965). I also wondered how successful Loeb was in his own investment endeavors. Sure, he spent many years at the now defunct E. F. Hutton, eventually becoming chairman, but how well did he do or the company for that matter under his guidance? I certainly would not want to take advice from someone who was only moderately successful or worse yet, a failure. I almost put the book down just as quickly as I picked it up - Loeb's writing style is difficult to follow, convoluted and extremely random at times. It may be a reflection of the prose of his time or perhaps he's just a poor writer, nevertheless, it is his first chapter - ""It Requires Knowledge, Experience and Flair"" that inspired me to continue.Sadly, I could only make it through 15 of the core 33 chapters. As I mentioned before, Loeb's writing style and lack of organized thoughts makes this book just too unbearable to read. I would imagine that most readers never make it past chapter 5 which could explain why after being in publication since 1935, there are so few reviews (anywhere).I did find some good nuggets of information but for the most part, the effort-to-reward ratio was just not good enough to justify further reading. Most of his concepts (and that's about all they are) have been repeated by many financial artisans for many years and I'm sure for many years to come. Whether they are Loeb's ideas or not, it's unlikely you'll be able to tell for sure.What follows, is a chapter-by-chapter analysis of what I personally got out of his book.Chapter 1 - It Requires Knowledge, Experience and Flair""Nothing is more difficult, I truly believe, than consistently and fairly profiting in Wall Street,"" and ""... the problem which the `Man on the Street,' often far from a success in his own field, thinks he easily can solve"" and several other bold statements in the same vein, provide a subtle, yet in-your-face analysis of the arrogance of the average investor who hopes to get something for nothing. As a result, Loeb states that it takes real knowledge gained from real experiences to even have a chance at success and even then, your success is questionable.He also believes, and I found this quite interesting, that market pricing is much less based on a company's fundamentals (balance sheet/income statement) than on a whole host of other influences including emotion.Even with the requisite knowledge and experience and even flair, you still might not succeed. This whole first chapter is a bit of ""tough"" love whereby Loeb wants you to know just how difficult it is to succeed in Wall Street and how (likely) ill-equipped you are at succeeding based on your more than (likely) common and unimpressive laurels. If you really want to succeed in Wall Street, you better ""step-up"" your ""game"" in a big way.If you haven't been traumatized too badly, Loeb rewards you with your first rule:Rule #1 - Buy only something that is quoted daily and can be bought and sold in an auction market daily.This is really quite simple and helps avoid one of the greatest pitfalls of trying to do too much, too fast and getting in over your head. Buy stocks you can easily sell if the need arises.To summarize, it's extremely difficult to become a successful investor in Wall Street. Most don't have what it takes and aren't willing to put in the time to be successful. If you aren't willing, move on. But if you are, work hard, very hard and good luck.Chapter 2 - Speculative Attitude EssentialWhat I think Loeb was saying here is that preservation of capital can only be attained through speculation. Let's clarify the meanings of ""preservation of capital"" and ""speculation"". ""Preservation of capital"" should mean that any offsets (e.g., taxes, inflation, fees, etc.) of capital should not diminish the future value of your initial capital investment. That is, capital invested today should have at least the same purchasing power in the future that it has today. For example, if you invested $1000 today into a tool yielding 3% annual interest, you would lose 1% of your capital at the end of one year if the annual rate of inflation was 4%. Thus, you would not be preserving your capital. Speculation in this context means to engage in an opportunity (investment) where the chance of reward is high. I don't believe he means one should throw caution to the wind, however.I think the chapter title is misleading. Ultimately, the goal is to make good money, but at the very least, one should preserve capital. This can only be done by engaging in opportunity that offers high reward - speculation. One or two large gains should offset and hopefully improve upon the several smaller losses one is likely to have. Go big or go home should be the message in this chapter.Chapter 3 - Is There an Ideal Investment?As if you really need to ask; but if you do, then ""no"" there isn't. Really, this is all he should have said and left it at that. Instead Loeb decided to go off on a journey where random thoughts came and went like fireflies in night. Nothing, really, was cohesive and one thought did not appear to be logically linked to the next. I found myself repeatedly reading the chapter over and over and each time feeling just as frustrated.There isn't an ideal investment but if you really want to succeed, you must separate yourself from the herd; don't do what everyone else is doing because their results are at best, lackluster. True success, just like true leaders is not found on every street corner. You must work hard to stand out and succeed.Chapter 4 - Pitfalls for the InexperiencedRestrict and focus your efforts; don't try to do too much. You must become an expert in the basics before you can even consider other investment vehicles. Start with ""active, seasoned issues, listed on a major Stock Exchange"" - echoing Loeb's first rule.Avoid the many distractions - IPOs, penny stocks, sucker mailings, etc. - that often prove fatal to the inexperienced. Specialization is preferred to dabbling. Be the best you can be in one or two endeavors, not ""so, so"" in many. Don't try to be a ""Jack of all trades, master of none."" The bottom line, KISS - keep it simple silly.Chapter 5 - How to Invest for Capital AppreciationThis chapter was filled with random thoughts and left me asking ""what does all this have to do with how I might invest for capital appreciation?"" The chapter has several general suggestions that don't tell me how, that might be better served in another chapter - ""General Guidelines"" perhaps. I'll leave the reading of this chapter to you to determine what you think is important.One thing is clear, however, Loeb believes your investment philosophy should be to invest for appreciation rather than income (e.g., dividends, etc.). Going one step further, he believes it's better to ""let cash lie idle"" rather than to invest for income. He believes this policy can keep you out of a potentially dangerous market. You could extrapolate that if there aren't any stocks worthy of investment, it's because the market has turned or is turning negative.Loeb promotes gaining more experience and suggests maintaining only one position at a time, with no more than 100 shares. Before moving on to another position, close out the current position. He believes this will offer you greater experience and allow you more time to focus and become more aware of the characteristics of successful investing. This philosophy of one position is opposite of diversification - a fairly radical approach even in today's market.Another of his conflicting mainstream philosophy is his advocacy of timing. He believes there are good and bad times to enter a position. I believe he's primarily concerned about timing stock purchases, but market timing surely plays a large role in that as well. What isn't clear is how he defines timing. He could mean the very short-term timing one might use as a day-trader or timing in the respect of not buying into a position until it's close to making a substantial movement. I would tend to think it would be closer to the former as he also promotes short-term investing over long-term - another highly polarized investing philosophy.Chapter 6 - Speculation vs. InvestmentIf you'll remember from chapter 2, speculation means to engage in an opportunity (investment) where the chance of reward is high. Loeb offers a specific goal: shoot to double your money. Investment, on the other hand is to play it safe - perhaps a 3-5% annual yield. Loeb argues that taking the investment approach offers little reward and provides little room for error, that even a single mistake could end up in a loss. Conversely, if you speculate to double your money, even falling short of your goal by 50%, for example, still leaves you making money. At the very least you preserve your capital. In short, the greater the risk, the greater the potential for reward.Chapter 7 - Sound Accounting for InvestorsThis chapter is comprised of about 2 pages that leaves you, quite frankly, scratching your head. The chapter could be easily summed up in one brief paragraph:You should regularly evaluate your holdings - he recommends monthly- to ensure they are meeting your goals, you are accounting for taxes and other costs and are staying on course. This should provide a general checkup of the health of your investment efforts.Chapter 8 - Why Commitments Should Not be HaphazardThe core meaning of this chapter is to stress how important it is to be fully aware of your commitments - your investments - and the management surrounding them. Most investors purchase a stock they like with hopes it go up in price - they have no idea how high it will go or how long it will take for that matter. They have very little awareness of their commitment. Loeb wants you to know ""why it was opened, what one expected to make, how long it was expected to take..."" and so on. The first paragraph of this chapter is crystal clear: know all you can about your commitments.Have an exit plan. We've all heard this before and people like William O' Neil provide suggestions such as cutting your losses at 8%. Loeb goes a step further, and if you follow his advice here, it should help increase your chance for success. Loeb's exit philosophy isn't limited to just when a loss is occurring, but also for when the commitment is doing well or not doing well but not taking its expected course. For example, let's say you buy a stock and expect an increase of 25% over the course of one month. What is your exit plan? Do you sell once you achieve your goal? Do you sell at the end of the month even if you did not achieve your goal? Loeb wants you to think deeply about every aspect of your commitments. In other words, know it like the back of your hands.Chapter 9 - Some ""Don'ts"" in Security ProgramsDon't invest solely for income or merely to ""keep capital employed"" or investing ""to hedge against inflation."" Loeb asserts (conflicts with his theme that it's unlikey you will succeed) that once you attain a certain level of competence, are able to speculate for large gains and you are able to ""expertly"" time purchases, there is no need for diversification and your perceived risks will in fact be conservative over time.You should buy the best and at the best time. Bargains are normally found when the masses fear and are afraid to buy. Buying when everyone else is buying and the sentiment is high is a recipe for poor opportunities.Get into the habit of thinking about your ultimate results rather than current or daily results. Your goal should be 100% gain over a longer period rather than many short gains over a short period of time.Chapter 10 - What to look for in Corporate ReportsHe really doesn't tell you specifically what to look for in a corporate report. He does, however, impress upon you the need to thoroughly scrutinize any company you might choose to be involved with. Look for strong cash reserves. With few exceptions - smaller upstarts - companies that finance growth and expansion with debt do not exhibit sound cash management decisions. (This is quite interesting since the companies listed in Wall Street are doing just that and many quite successfully. But I would speculate that what Loeb is getting at is that few cash savvy companies expand without going into debt or at least limited debt and those are the ones you want to consider.) He feels that companies that must constantly rely on financing imply ""an unprofitable field, poor management, or unwise overdevelopment."" After all, a company that has strong financials can finance their own expansion (or at least much of it) without going into debt.Look for unwise decisions such as write-downs and as previously mentioned, expansion financed with debt. Read between-the-lines; a one million dollar increase in revenue may not be all that exciting if there was a one-time asset sale of 750K during the same period.At the end of the day, you want to find a company with strong fundamentals, a company that can manage its finances and show profits. Again, Loeb doesn't offer specifics here but does leave you with the impetus to learn.Chapter 11 - Concerning Financial Information, Good and BadAnother long-winded, drawn-out chapter filled with convolution; one sentence was longer than most average paragraphs. The message in this chapter is to pay close attention to your information and try to fully understand its meanings and implications, for the road to success is full of pitfalls. Even insider information is dangerous and at times no more advantageous than the information the average person already has access to. In fact, in some instances it can be detrimental - especially when the information provided is inaccurate or comes from someone with less than honorable intentions.Chapter 12 - What to Buy - and WhenThis chapter provides a considerable amount of relevant information and is worthy of a detailed reading. Loeb offers many general guidelines that need further research to expound his thoughts. He promotes the ""buy low and sell high"" mantra. In order to find these rare gems, there are a few prevailing characteristics:* Popular market sentiment should be bearish.* The securities market should be well liquidated (sold to the point where prices are very low).* Current business conditions are poor or expected to become poor.* The stock is ""out of favor"" with the general population. It will generally have a low rating.* Earnings are abnormally low or expected to become low.* Dividends are non-existent or lower than normal.* The stock price must reflect the current sentiment. A low outlook of a stock should have an equally low price.As already stated, you'll need to expound on some of his concepts but the ideas are there. As the speculator, you need to take an opposing position. In your mind, that stock that is ""out of favor"" with the masses, and receives low ratings is really a diamond in the rough and its current share price is not a true reflection of its potential. But don't take this stance blindly. You must back your decision with sound information. I'm not sure what he means by ""sound"". If a stock's fundamentals are weak, how can one choose it based on ""sound"" information?You buy low when the stock is out of favor and undesirable to the masses. Then when the masses take notice and start buying, it will push the share price higher; to an eventual sell point. Think of the ""institutional sponsorship"" concept promoted by William O' Neal. According to Loeb, ""the objective is to always buy that which the majority thinks is speculative and sell it when the majority believes the quality has reached investment grade."" However, weigh the ""possibilities for profit vs. the risk for loss.""Chapter 13 - Importance of Correct TimingLoeb repeats the importance of getting into the market only when the pros outweigh the cons. Based on his concept of speculation, I'd say the pros must heavily outweigh the cons. Once an investment is entered, your decision process becomes much more difficult. There are many more variables to consider and you must have the fortitude to ignore emotion - especially in times of loss. Losses must but cut swiftly and for the most part, forgotten. I like the concept of forgetting - it helps you move on and avoid that negative tendency of dwelling on ""what ifs."" Moving on allows you to focus on the future.If you set your return goals high and achieve a high rate of return, you can sit on the side-lines for greater periods of time while searching for the next great investment. Cash reserves allow you the opportunity to enter a position when the timing is right.Chapter 14 - Statistical Analysis, Market Trends, and Public PsychologyLoeb asserts that statistics are rarely of value because they are mostly concerned with theory or academic s and ignore the more import fundamental trends. I'm not really sure what he's trying to say here. Surely, statistics can be made about fundamental trends. For example, one might say ""the average bear market lasts 10 months."" This could be statistically supported and would be related to the fundamentals of the market.Market trends should be determined first before looking at a stock purchase. The best stock will likely do poorly in a down trending market if you bought expecting to go long, for example. Predicting market tops and bottoms is not possible and trying to do so will lead, ultimately, to failure. You aren't really looking at where the current market is at, but where it's going - trending.Loeb states, ""The most important single factor in shaping security markets is public psychology."" You want to try to determine the state of the masses and approximate where you think they are heading and benefit from their actions. He goes as far as claiming the name of a stock ""is an important factor in securing or losing public favor."" I would imagine, as having at times witnessed extremely odd, opposing and conflicting behavior that market psychology is a difficult thing to gage consistently.And his final piece of information is to keep in mind, when performing other analysis, a securities past appraisals as guidance to its future price. What is he trying to say here? Does it relate to market psychology or market fundamentals or both? I'm not really sure.Chapter 15 - Price Movement and Other Market Action FactorsActual price movement is the most important factor in forming an opinion on the general trend of the market. So while you might think a security has some theoretical value (and trading above or below) or the market should be trending one direction or the other, it really doesn't matter. It's what is actually occurring that matters most.It's dangerous to resist the market's trend - despite thinking or knowing you are right. Prices of securities sell for exactly what the market thinks they are worth at any given time. One could extrapolate that certain security valuations (such as EPS), have little to do with a stock's ultimate price than how desirable or undesirable a stock is to the public at any given time.The market behaves due to many factors - important or not. The current market is a reflection of all these factors. One of the most important (and in my humble opinion, the one most are least apt to predict) is market psychology.Loeb outlines three types of investors ranging from ""sheep"" (my words) to the ""successful type"" (his words). Public sheep follow the market up or down with no real reasons for buying or selling. If selling is taking place, as reflected by the market, they will sell and vice-versa. The second group, chart and tape readers are rarely successful if that's all they rely on for buying and selling. (But it would appear he's just guessing.) The successful investor takes all things into consideration - market direction, fundamentals, incompetence, etc. - and tries to determine if what is currently taking place is supported by current data and will continue into the future.Loeb has often mentioned how much of a role market psychology plays and emphasizes how difficult it is to interpret and predict. However, he states ""the action of the market itself can be expected under most circumstances to stimulate buying or selling in a manner consistent enough to allow reasonably accurate forecasting of news in advance of its actual occurrence."" What does this mean? Does he mean that if the market is trending up and negative news occurs, that we can expect this to negatively impact the market or least have a minor impact, for example? I've witnessed too many days where stocks fall on good news and rise on bad. Too often there seems no rhyme or reason. I highly doubt Loeb's suggestion for predicting market moves based on market psychology is anything much more than a coin toss.Timing also plays a critical role when evaluating the market. The same event can have different and opposite meanings depending on when the event takes place. For example, bad news at the end of a long bullish cycle can signal a pending change in the market direction and reaction by the market might be swift and overreacted. Bad news during a bearish cycle may have little impact as the status quo continues bearish.Loeb doesn't really believe in confirmation analysis yet provides suggestions of his own confirmations. He also doesn't put much faith in technical analysis. He feels both market confirmations and technical analysis are theoretical in nature and not likely of much value in reality.To summarize Loeb's thoughts, you need to be able to evaluate and interpret all variables (most importantly market psychology) in order to establish any type of solid conclusions as to the market's behavior. Even then and for various reasons, it's easy to draw the wrong conclusions. Loeb concedes then, that this endeavor is ""the most inexact sort of science.""* Market direction and price movement are two very important indicators.* Look for confirmation. Are other stocks following the market leaders?* High volume with light concessions can indicate a bullish sentiment, especially if the negative news would normally be expected to result in a greater price decrease.* Look for stocks showing strength when going up and resistance when going down. IOW, when the general market is climbing, its price is increasing more than the average and when the market is declining, its price is decreasing slower than the average.* Don't fight the tape.",Business & Economics

In large messure, he modelled the history in the stories after the fall of the Roman Empire.Hari Seldon, Salvor Hardin, Hober Mallow are names that stand in the history of Science Fiction like the names of real people in many ways. &quot;Violence is the last resort of the incompetent&quot; and &quot;Never let your morals get in the way of doing what is right&quot; are quotes that every reader of SF knows well.Only names like Jubel Harshaw and David Bowman (who came to life from the pens of Robert Heinlein and Arthur C.

I'm not positive if this is the best SF/F novel ever written, but it definitely makes the top five list of best SF novels ever written.It is a great loss to the world that Asimov slipped off his mortal coil back in 1992.

To avoid a Dark Age, he sets up the Foundation at the outer edge of the galaxy to preserve the knowledge of humanity. The stories in Foundation deal with the formative years of the Foundation and its growth from an (outwardly) academic's and historian's interest into a power on (and behind) the galactic stage guiding humanity's redevelopment.Cleverly written and plotted with quick-moving events and the interesting theory that humanity's future for hundreds and thousands of years can be predicted based on probable outcomes.

The stashes typically contain things like CDs, DVDs, books, non-perishable food items, maps, inexpensive gifts and trinkets, and so on. Enthusiasts sometimes follow a trail of clues like an old treasure hunt to find the cache, in addition to using their GPS system. They can be buried in the ground in remote wilderness areas or left under a park bench in a city. There are caches in every U.S. state and many countries around the world, from England to Estonia. The book gives the GPS coordinates of each cache.Since the game was invented a few years ago, it has rapidly evolved and many new variations have been invented, including geodashing, garmin games, geoteaming, hide and seek, just 4 openers, letterboxing, microcaching, minute war, multicaches, orienteering, poker run, project ape, tag, virtual caches, webcam caches, volksmarching, story cache, and something called the ""stampin' fools game.""The book covers GPS basics as well as the history of the technology, and the chapters include GPS units, Creating Caches, Geo Games (which I just listed the names of above), Backcountry Safety and Etiquette, Geo Happenings, Clubs and Websites, and Cachinary 1.0.The book has a forward by Dave Ulmer, the inventer of the sport, including the dramatic story of his snowmobile crash on Mt. St. Helens back in the days when the civilian GPS system accuracy was only 1/10 of what it is now--which was the reason for his crash. Because of that positioning error, he'd gotten into the chute right next to the one he was supposed to be in, which led to his crash.Overall, this is an interesting, entertaining, and detailed introduction to the sport of geocaching that should be of interest to beginning and seasoned geocachers alike.",Sports & Recreation

B00086TLE2,Up from slavery: An autobiography,,A2Q7YBUV8IPTLW,John K. Reed,2/5,4.0,957484800,Inspirational. Timeless principles. Yet Flawed.,"As a 21st century African American, I must take issue with Mr. Washington's statement regarding how in all things social we can be totally seperate and unequal.Even though I can understand the practicality and expediency of making that sort of concession At That Time in history I still must question whether or not a statement such as that is a representation of true liberty and justice for all. In my mind it is not. It wasn't true then and it still isn't true today.Despite the tremendous Economic strides that have been made by people of color globally and particularly in the U.S., thanks in no small part to the efforts of great people like Mr. Washington, the society at large has remained very stratified. Attitudes though much improved have largely remained the same. Statements like the esteemed Mr. Washington's have too often served to dismiss the responsibility of offenders to remedy past wrongs which still have impact in the present day. They also serve to deny true equality of opportunity to all citizens. It also accomodates the offenders far greater than is deserved and does grave injustice to black and white alike. Mr. Washington makes reference himself to how injustices done to the black populace are just as injurious to the white population. Yet he does not view social seperatism as an injustice. With that I must take issue.All that notwithstanding it is an interesting, informative, and enjoyable read. Many of the principles by which he lived are as true today as they were during Reconstruction. However, certain opinions that he expressed could have the effect of limiting economic opportunity by confining Blacks to the ranks of laborers rather than entrepreneurs, managers, and other professionals if too stringently adhered to. These pursuits require concentrated study and effort by themselves.So read it but be sure to place it in the proper context.",Biography & Autobiography

Using it for 6 weeks with cardio improved my physique. I lost a lot of inches and I can see my body really change. I am so happy with it! I even borrowed and eventually bought his other books. The Look Great in Sleeveless is also very good. It has lots of similarities with the Sculpting book or even repeats his explanations of the basics of how things should be done or how our bodies work, etc. but I still find the Sleeveless Book complements the Sculpting book very well (Sleeveless book has versions for home use). If you're unsure and feel it might be a waste of money, try borrowing it from the library, read it and then put what you read into use. Most likely, like me, you'll end up buying a copy for you won't be able to live without it either!",Sports & Recreation
0681994851,Jane Eyre,,A3TIKOTO0G2TYR,Michael C. Walch,1/2,4.0,1207094400,A triumphant classic,"Jane Eyre is the story of a young girl who grows up and is forever contrary to her society. The book foreshadows the penalties that society gives for such opposition, but Jane still remains opposed to the role society wants her to have. In Jane Eyre, Charlotte Bronte uses foreshadowing, symbolism, and conflict to show her society how a woman can overcome the conventions of her society to live a happy and full life.An example of foreshadowing comes during Jane's engagement. First there is the splitting of the chestnut tree (page 226), soon after Rochester and Jane become engaged: ""Before I left my bed in the morning, little Adele came running in to tell me that the great horse-chestnut at the bottom of the orchard had been struck by lightning in the night, and half of it split away."" This event foreshadows how the upcoming wedding between Jane and Rochester will divide the two, sending one away, because they are not ready for marriage. It is not until Jane and Rochester both overcome the conventions of their society that they can have a happy marriage.The most dramatic example of foreshadowing comes right after Jane's dreams. After waking from her disturbing dreams, Jane sees a light in her room and finds a grotesque female figure standing over her (250). The figure is Bertha Mason, who came to terrify Jane out of marriage. After rending Jane's veil in two, Bertha leaves and Jane collapses. The rending of the veil foreshadows the obstacle still in front of Jane's upcoming marriage, and it is not until this obstacle is dealt with that Jane can marry.Aside from foreshadowing, Charlotte Bronte uses symbolism, mostly of birds, to show how Jane's society confines her. For example, Jane's surname comes from the word for a bird's nest, aerie. Rochester gives an additional example of the bird symbolism on page 232 when he says ""Jane, be still, don't struggle so, like a wild frantic bird that is rending its own plumage in its desperation."" Rochester says this when he is trying to convince Jane that they can be married. At this time Jane is struggling with the barriers that her society places on their union. Jane is the bird that society traps in a cage, keeping her away from the man she wants to marry. Eventually, Jane does find a way to overcome her cage and obtain happiness with Rochester.Bronte also uses people to symbolize certain aspects of her society. Mr. Brocklehurst, for example, is the epitome of hypocrisy, as shown during his inspection of Lowood. While surveying the girls in the school, Mr. Brocklehurst condemns one for having naturally curly hair, a vanity of the world in his opinion, and yet Brocklehurst goes so far as to buy curled wigs for his wife and daughters. In addition to this, Brocklehurst manages the funds of Lowood and never allocates enough money to keep the girls sufficiently warm or well fed. Instead of teaching the girls to live pious and frugal lives, he leaves them weakened in front of the onslaught of winter illnesses. These characteristics of Mr. Brocklehurst make him a symbol of the typical man from Jane's society. Jane's ability to overcome the wrongs he does to her shows her society how to rise above society and obtain a happy life.Throughout this book, Jane clashes with the conventions of her society until she rises above them. The greatest example of Jane's opposition to her society is in her successful marriage to Rochester. ""Reader, I married him,"" Jane says on page 397. Jane does not say that they were married, or that Rochester proposed to her again. Instead, she states that she took the active role and married Rochester. Such assertion from a woman went against the standard role of women in Bronte's time. Jane opposes the role that society has established for her and rises above it, obtaining the thing that truly made her happy.Charlotte Bronte focuses on overcoming the conventions of her society by having Jane Eyre oppose and surmount them. Foreshadowing shows how society will react to such opposition, such as when Jane and Rochester are initially engaged. Symbolism also helps to illustrate the confines of convention; they cage Jane just like a bird. And the various clashes between Jane and other characters, even her society, further illustrated the limitations of conventionality. But opposing and overcoming the conventionality of society can lead to true and lasting happiness.",Literary Criticism

This true story has been noted as the inspiration for Melvilles - 'Moby Dick'. The tale is well written and provides some background into the whaling industry at that time, and the crew members on that ill-fated voyage.Captain Pollard embarks on this voyage as the new captain of the Essex. Along with the first mate Owen Chase and cabin boy Thomas Nickerson, and eighteen others they set out for the Pacific whaling grounds in search of filling their hold with barrels of whale oil. The journey starts with mishap as the ship is 'knocked-over' on its side during a storm. The captain is convinced not to turn back and continues on.Once in the Pacific thay start filling their hold, and decide to head further west in search of whales. As the crew persue a pod of whales, the Essex is attacked by a bull male. The ship is struck twice and begins to sink. The crew salvage as much as possible from the sinking ship and eventually leave to head for land. Instead of heading to the nearby islands because of a fear of cannibals, the crew head for South American. This decision provse to be a fatal one for a majority of the crew.The book tells the grueling story of the survival of Pollard, Chase, Nicherson and Lawrence. We see the terrible effects of starvation and what drove these men to finally turn to cannibalism.This book is a great read for fans of Moby-Dick and of the terrible journey of survival. This tales reminds me of the other survival stories such as the Shackleton expedition, and 'Into Thin Air'. Enjoy!",History

This course was based on the worst example of a European textbook (filled with information, but extremely hard to grasp), it was impossible to understand chemistry from this source only. So I looked for alternatives.By sheer luck, I stumbled upon Atkins' book on a bookstore shelf. As soon as I started reading it, I was captivated. Everything that did not make much sense in the other book now was perfectly clear. The illustrations are beautiful, e.g. giving you a feel of what each element looks like in vivid color. This was one of the best textbooks I had ever encountered. It only took me a month or two to learn it all from cover to cover, and I guess what? - I passed the exam with an A, and with the compliments of the professor, congratulating me for my thorough knowledge - something I wouldn't dream of just a few months before. This was the first example for me of what a difference a good textbook can make.If you want to learn and understand chemistry, even if you're starting from scratch, this is the book to use!Later on, I read several other Atkins' books.

B000PBZH6Q,Foundation,,AUQESAE2BVBCI,Gustavo M. Hobold,2/3,5.0,1298160000,Takes you deep to analyze patterns of society,"All I can say, for warm start, is that Isaac Asimov is a genius. Acclaimed Hugo Award winner, he really makes you feel a part of the future, as he proves to be a genius not only in a robot way of thinking, but also in politics, economy, religion, mass manipulation and, of course, in every way that makes a human, human. And I am pretty sure this characteristic of him is really connected to his also great robotics series.Imagine yourself in the future. Now imagine yourself in a further future where you are studying the chronology of the future. Remember your history classes in school? Yeah, that's where he's taking you. Analyzing the Galactic Empire from a distant and omnipotent way of view, he sets a pattern in the development of mankind that repeats itself various and various times, that's why this book could be written set in Middle Age. But it isn't and that's one of the most fascinating things about it.Everything starts when Hari Seldon, a famous psychohistorian - a new science developed by himself based in history, statistics and mathematics - predicts the fall of the Galactic Empire. To save mankind from thousands years of darkness and restart, he suggests setting a new colony at the fringe of the Galaxy - Terminus System - to develop the greatest literacy work of history and regroup all knowledge ever acquired: the Encyclopedia Galactica.Set as a scientific colony and lacking natural resources, the Foundation, as it is called, starts to suffer of politics and diplomatic issues and that's just where all the greatness starts coming. As it's well more developed in technology and science than the rest of Periphery - as they call the region of the galaxy containing the Terminus system - other colonies start trading natural resources, such as gold and iron, for scientific gadgets to control their masses.Based on science, there is created a new religion in which priests are, actually, researchers and technicians. It was Arthur C. Clarke who once said that high level technology is indistinguishable from magic, though it makes perfect sense for this novel, except we are not taking magic in consideration, but religion (although they are equal if you look from a different angle, but this is not to be discussed in this review). To control masses in the Four Kingdoms of Periphery, they sell science. And it works pretty well until there's a crisis, and another, and another. In each of them, those called Seldon Crisis and taken in consideration when the psychohistorian predicted the need of Foundation, he appears and hints a new period of development.But it is not only religion that control masses and it is not only faith that is needed in human race, but also trading, protection, food, gadgets, industry and, of course, a stable economy. Nuclear force moves everything in the future, that's how Asimov puts it and he puts it so well that he really makes us think if isn't it the power we should explore - consider this book was written in the beginning of nuclear power.The book is well-split in five sections: The Psychohistorians, The Encyclopedists, The Mayors, The Traders and The Merchant Princes. In each of those, Asimov explores a deep wound in human civilization, psychology and sociology, based on a few dominating aspects, and shows that it is even easier to overpower an entire society poking only its foundation.It is a masterpiece, well-thought from the beginning to the last word. That's all I have to say.95/100",Education

A relatively recent publication of one of the survivor's accounts, adds to Nathaniel Philbrick's grasp.

Tanith lived with wolves as a small child before the tribe of Ahear came to kill the wolves and return her to human society, treating her as nothing more than a slave. Soon she begins to long to return to the wolves, who treated her more kindly than any human ever did. But a young man from a neighboring tribe inevitably falls in love with her and offers her a home with his less savage clan. Tanith is left to chose between the worlds of wolves and humans. It's actually something like Julie of the Wolves, but far more detailed in plot and character, and worthy of a wider range of audiences.

0505524236,Night Visitor (Timeswept),,A1VAB8C7JS63H1,Tasha B.,11/22,2.0,986860800,"Original, but Often Confusing","NIGHT VISITOR, by Melanie Jackson, purports to be a ghost story/romance--the blurb on the back cover would certainly lead one to believe that--but in actuality it's more of a quasi-paranormal/time travel/fairy tale romance. Although one can't help but admire Jackson's originality, VISITOR was often confusing, both in the way the story was structured and in the writing itself, and the characterizations suffered because of this. NIGHT VISITOR will appeal to some people, especially those who love anything to do with Scotland, but it's not a particularly good novel, despite its inventiveness.Okay, here's the premise: In 1888, Tafaline, a young woman who's rather independent for the time period, is spending the summer helping her misogynistic father photograph archaeological sites in Scotland. When the bones of &quot;The Piper&quot; are found in a castle called Duntrune, Taffy is called in to photograph them for prosterity. According to legend, The Piper had his hands chopped off for playing his pipes in order to warn someone named McColla that Duntrune was under siege by the evil Campbells (actually, it technically wasn't under siege, because it was the Campbells' castle to begin with, but never mind). Now, he's a ghost. Legend also says that anyone who touches the bones of a ghost will have that ghost haunt them until they go mad--unless they're a MacLeod, in which case they'll simply be called away to the land of the fairies. Of course, Taffy touches the Piper's bones, so guess what happens next.As I mentioned before, the story is pretty original, but the way it was told was utterly confusing to me. For one thing, why open the novel with the bishop, several months AFTER the Piper's bones have been discovered, especially since the bishop doesn't play hardly any role at all in the story? Also, when the book first shifts over to Malcolm's (the piper's) viewpoint (page 36, just in case anyone was wondering), the date listed is 1964! Now, I'm admittedly not well-versed on Scottish history, but I don't think all this war stuff was going on in the sixties in Scotland--which means that the date was either a mistake, which is really incredibly sloppy, or simply nonsensical. Furthermore, once Malcolm does enter the picture, the point of view between him and Taffy changes so often that it's hard to get a sense of the characters. They both do a lot of stuff, but I can't recall them ever feeling anything in the way of emotions. Thus, while they both seem like very interesting characters at the very beginning of the novel, they quickly become flat and two-dimensional.All in all, NIGHT VISITOR wasn't what I expected it to be. It lies off the beaten path of paranormal/time travel/fairy romances, and thus might turn some people off--truly, I would only recommend this book to fans of the OUTLANDER series and to those who enjoy Scottish historicals.",Fiction

Well, sort of -- it's Nobel Prize Winner John Galsworthy's sprawling family epic ""The Forsyte Saga."" While it has a distinctly soapy flavor, ""Saga"" retains its dignity and look at turn-of-the-century mores and society.The Forsyte family is determinedly regal and hard-nosed, almost to the point of a fault. One staid family member, Soames Forsyte, becomes obsessed with the beautiful but poor Irene, and finally gets her to marry him -- on condition that if their marriage doesn't work, she walks. Well, their marriage doesn't work. Soames is frustrated that Irene shuts him out of her life and her bed -- even more so when he learns that she is in love with sexy, arty architect Bosinney, who is building them a new house.Soames rapes Irene and ruins Bosinney. His marriage falls into ruins, and Bosinney is killed in a car accident. So Irene leaves permanently, living in an apartment by herself. Then Soames announces that he wants to marry a pretty French girl, Annette, and Irene weds Soames' cousin. But the problems of the older generation get inherited by the younger one -- Soames's daughter falls madly in love with Irene's son, but their parents' secret pasts doom their love.Three novels (""A Man of Property,"" ""In Chancery,"" and ""To Let""), connected with two short stories (""Indian Summer of a Forsyte"" and ""Awakening"") -- it's a pretty big story, sprawling over three generations and four decades. It's a bit soapy, with all the scandal and family weirdness, but the dignified writing keeps it from seeming sordid.It's a credit to Galsworthy that he can communicate so much without ever getting into his characters' heads. He displays emotion in undemonstrative people like Irene through little mannerisms and twitches. At the same time, he can give us heartrending looks into aging patriarch Old Jolyon's lonely mind. His writing is very nineteenth century, dignified and with plenty of furniture/clothing details. It's pretty dense, but all right once you get used to it.Galsworthy was a solid supporter of women's rights, and you can see in Irene and Soames' relationship -- Soames, who sees his wife as another piece of property, and the determined Irene who only wants her own happiness, but can't afford to live on her own. Their respective kids Jon and Fleur are nice but kind of boring beside their darker, more intense parents.For a look at the social shifts that helped define the twentieth century, take a look at the ""Forsyte Saga."" Or if you just want to soak in a tale of family woe, love, hate and dark secrets, ""Saga"" still works.",Fiction

And why is this a repeating pattern with all the guys I date? Things are great, and then they suddenly walk away and I never speak to them again.I read this book and it all became crystal clear. While in the relationship, I thought I was making an effort to NOT be clingy or needy or anything of the sort. Now I realize I was giving off that vibe without even REALIZING it. I always went to his place, I left the decisions for what we were doing up to him, I wouldn't make plans with my friends until I knew if I was doing something with him that night...

Now that I am older I can relate to the Forsytes more and see Irene as a selfish woman who wrecked an entire family - primarily Soames, June, Old Jolyon and her own son, Jon - and whose only redeeming feature was her beauty. And I find it incredible that Galsworthy won the Nobel Prize when so many greater writers - Tolstoy, Twain and Proust, just to name a few - were ignored.

The book really gives you good ideas on what you can do at the gym, without feeling intimidated because you are unsure of what you're doing. The descriptions of each exercise are helpful because the words are easy to understand...after all, this shouldn't be made more complicated with fancy words.What I've doing now is incorporating a new exercise for a muscle group each week, just to familiarize myself with them.

The Discovery of Subatomic Particles is accessible to anyone, an easy read revealing much about scientific method. It's more a history of how scientists and physicists with rather rudimentary tools devised innovative ways to probe and measure atomic particles with surprisingly accurate results. This book will be appreciated by the mechanically inclined. For the mathematically inclined, you will see in the appendices calculations developed in such a way that requires only a basic background in algebra to understand.The author guides the reader through the history of processes that refined our understanding of the subatomic world. The subject matter is covered in a logical timeline progression and consistent format. Quantum theory is outside the scope of this book, but Niels Bohr is included in the history for using some of the discoveries to formulate his view of electron dynamics. The reader will gain a higher appreciation of how much can be measured and discovered using the basic tools and instruments available at a given level of scientific development.Extensive appendices amount to a concise development of fundamental physics, itself creating much value owning this book. My favorite appendix has the author describing how much of Rutherford's formula for the scattering of alpha particles can be derived through simple dimensional analysis, continuing the historic application of basic tools to analyze, measure, and discover subatomic particles. The appendices give the technical details supporting much of the scientific development described so well in the main text.

At any rate, it's a comprehensive book on classical technical analysis (that being chart patterns).The main down sides to this book are that it's a dry read and it lacks an evidence-based approach. What I mean by that last part is that many times the authors simply say ""in our opinion this is so"" or ""in our experience we find that this happens."" That really equates to a focus group of one and can be a recipe for causality errors/confusion.

However, what could have been a thoughtful, ironic, heartwarming story quickly became plotless and one-dimensional. Do Patty's parents really possess no good qualities whatsoever? Is Anton really the saint he seems? This novel makes no attempt to answer any of these questions, and that's what makes it so painful to read. Patty, who is clearly intended to be the endearing heroine, comes off as a know-it-all with a total disregard for rules and boundaries. Also, doesn't a seemingly romantic relationship between a 12-year-old and a 19-year-old feel questionable at the very least?

It has an informal choice of Java programming topics, where these are unlikely to be seen in other, more comprehensive and conventional Java texts. Plus, Holzner uses the latest major release, Java 1.5.To be sure, you really must have some nodding acquaintance with Java. Not necessarily 1.5, mind you. But part of the book's focus is that it does not waste your time going over basic issues like syntax and the core classes.The book exposes you to more than just the standard Java 1.5 distribution from Sun. You should already know that the latter has two sets of widgets - the original AWT and the newer Swing, where Swing is often considered to be better than AWT. But there is another widget toolkit, called SWT. Freely offered by IBM. It has been well received by many Java programmers as being superior to AWT and Swing. In Chapter 8, on making a custom web browser, for example, Holzner shows the virtues of SWT. Purely in terms of broadening your Java experience, it is worth checking SWT out.Holzner also puts in a strong plug for Eclipse. An Integrated Development Environment that is free and open source. (It also originated from IBM.) It offers the promise of a very nice, high productivity context in which to code your Java. Its proponents suggest that Eclipse and Java can match any Microsoft IDE for coding VB.NET or C#.You see, if you treat the book correctly, it's not the topics themselves that are the most important items. Don't get me wrong. They are certainly interesting in their own right. Rather, it's the broadening of your knowledge en route that is the book's main attraction.",Computers

A few sentences destroying a straw man of relativism does not prove theistic absolutism nor does the existence of moral outrage prove that there are objective moral principles.The book does however demonstrate an approach for the thinking Christian but is far more effective in dealing with the lunatic fringe of Christianity who advocate ""Creation Science"", violence, racism etc. in the name of their God than it is with dealing with a determined critic of Christianity.The open minded skeptic will find much of interest in this book.",Religion

0736001549,Sculpting Her Body Perfect,,,,171/173,5.0,985219200,excellent book!,"Sculpting Her Body Perfect is one of the best women's weight training books I have ever read. There is a lot of great information about isolation versus compound exercises, push-pull muscles, cardio training and weight training intensity.Sculpting starts by outlining why women's body sculpting is more challenging than men's body sculpting, and provides reasons why women should do weight training. He then moves to his body sculpting program, which he claims will provide tone but not bulk to women's bodies. There are three phases, and in each phase you weight train 3x per week, with cardio 3-5x/week. What changes is how the weight training is structured.Phase one is a body conditioning phase, and includes three full body days. Each day includes one exercise per body part, changing the exercise for each day. (E.g., for day 1 quads you might do squats, day 2 lunges, and day 3 leg press.) For each exercise you do 3 sets of 15 reps, at 75% maximum weight. Each body part is worked 3x per week. This stage is to build muscle -- he stresses that you can't shape muscle unless you first have muscle. He recommends staying with this phase for 3-6 months, and says you will reach 50% of your potential with this phase.Phase two is the toning and shaping phase, and lasts at least 6 months. Here the body is split into two: e.g., day 1 - chest, back, shoulders and calves; and day 2- biceps, triceps, quads, hamstrings and abs. You still do weights three days a week, but alternate day 1 and day 2. Each body part is worked 3 x every two weeks. You use two exercises per body part in a superset, still doing 3 sets of 15 reps for each exercise. The intensity of the weights is increased in this phase. The goal is to create muscle symmetry and proportion, and he says you will reach 90% of your genetic potential with this phase.Phase three is targeted body sculpting. The body is split into three - e.g., day 1 - chest and back, day 2 - shoulders, biceps and triceps, day 3 - legs and abs. Each body part is given three exercises in a superset. You still do 3 sets of 15 reps at high intensity, and you are still training 3 days a week, but now each body part is worked one day per week. He claims you will reach your full potential at this stage, but he stresses that you need to have gone through the first two phases for this approach to work.Overall, it is a great book - well written and seems very well researched. The weaknesses are that there is nothing about diet, there is a strong preference for gyms over home workouts, and he doesn't provide exact workout schedules (but he does provide examples.) I would love to see a video series that uses this approach.",Sports & Recreation

Patty lives in a small town in Alabama. The town is quiet and mainly Jewish. When a Prisoner of War camp is established, the whole town sort of goes coo-coo! When one of them escapes Patty hides him and secretly falls in love with him. But when the FBI comes into play, she doesn't know what to do. Will she be put in jail if they find out she is hiding him? This book is a good book for people who can stick with books.Summer of my German Soldier by Bette Greene is suspenseful. One example from the book is when Patty's father is angry with her and starts to beat her. This was suspenseful because he could, if was angry enough, beat her to death. Another example is when Anton escapes and she hides him, but can't remember hiding him. This is suspenseful because she tries to take food to him but is stopped by her father. Another suspenseful part is when the FBI agents come and question her about the disappearance of the POW escapee, Anton. Because she is hiding him, you don't know what she'll say and thus it is suspenseful.This book, also, has romance. This romance is not what you would usually think of, but just a secret love for each other and nothing more. A part in the book that is romantic is when Patty's father starts to beat her and Anton comes out of hiding, but decides for his and her sake not to interfere. This is romantic because it is the first sign that Anton really cares about Patty's safety. Another romantic scene is when Anton decides to run away to New York. Patty secretly climbs out of her window to say good-bye. He gives her his family ring and they both realize they truly love each other. This is romantic because on this moonlit night they both tell each other how much they love one another. The last example is when Patty finds out Anton was found and killed. This is romantic and sad because she was truly in love with Anton and gets very emotional.This book starts out boring but gets more interesting as the book progresses.

This has to be my favorite line of the whole book which was thought by young Jolyon Forsyte about his tragic cousin Soames. It also sums up what the entire long family saga is about, possessions whether they are tangible or human. This book is so brilliant because it has a little bit of everything including family secrets, adultry, forbidden love, gambling, and scandal. It almost sounds like a soap opera but is only so much better. Another brillant part of the book is the fact that all the characters are so human none of them are perfect and each has their own set of flaws. At first I didn't think I was going to like the fact that there was no real hero but I have to say that it makes for some interesting reading. Another thing I liked about Galsworthy's writing of the book is that readers never really know what Irene is thinking, the only interpretations you get from her are what other characters give you. This makes her as elusive as she is described in the book. You either are going to love her or hate her. I found myself hating her at the beginning of the novel because I pitied poor Soames for receiving no love from her but by the time the interlude had occured, I found myself liking her more, especially because of her treatment of Old Jolyon. I started hating and piting Soames more and more, even his own daughter dislikes him. If you like LONG invloved novels with detailed descriptions about time and places you will love this book. It is really one of the great works of the 20th century and I think this author was way before his time. I look forward to reading the other two novels about the Forsyte family in he future.",Fiction

B000PBZH6Q,Foundation,,A1AUBGENRIZODO,Dave Deubler,1/1,5.0,1072051200,The Golden Age Classic Continues,"Asimov's Golden Age classic Foundation Trilogy is one of the early milestones of the science fiction genre. This second installment is less episodic than the first volume, focusing on just two specific stories. The first volume, &quot;Foundation&quot;, sets up the whole idea of the Seldon Plan, a mathematically based view of sociopolitical forces that enables one brilliant scientist to grow a new galactic empire from a foundation of one hundred thousand scientists and their families. &quot;Empire&quot; starts off in the same vein, showing how the Foundation staves off annihilation at the hands of the currently decaying, but still dangerous Galactic Empire. Once again, the magic of this section is the subtle means by which the Foundation overcomes impossible odds, and the convincing arguments Asimov uses to make the solution seem inevitable. Part Two involves an internal struggle between the Foundation's authoritarian central government and the Independent Traders who spread that government's economic power. While the Foundation is threatened with civil war, the rise of a new warlord on Kalgan poses a danger to the entire human race.Because each story is substantially longer than those in Foundation, this volume focuses more on individual characters. In fact, it is not too much to say that a major theme is the historical question, ""Do individuals matter?"" As a result, the characters are developed slightly more, and there's even a wistful love triangle, and considerably more action than was featured in the first volume, which tended to be distant and impersonal. If you liked Foundation, you'll surely enjoy this and the climax to the series, Second Foundation.Although these books will strike many as hopelessly dated, Asimov's sweeping historical vision should not be missed by any fans of speculative fiction. They have a directness and honest charm about them that is rare in contemporary science fiction. Later additions to this series, both sequels and prequels, don't adhere to the tone of these original novels, and really add very little except bulk.",Education

I've read all his non-fiction. He's very objective and can sound a little bit like notes from a lecture. But it is also emotionally productive, without the bells and whistles, unlike many Christian authors, and has genuine feeling and vulerability to appeal to anyone's subjective sensibilities. This book is my favorite from this author. He wrote that walking with God is about tranformation by the Spirit, not a change of behavior. The author makes points about principles and leaves the reader in charge of how to purpose God based on teachings from the Bible. This message is biblical and encouraging to anyone who has accepted Christ but doesn't know what to do next. This book is not a self-help book. It's not a method plan. Many Christians love the book of Romans and should really take a look at this book as extracurricular. This book is not a substitute for reading the Bible but a companion, conversation piece, the result of the word of God in the author's live - which the author states could happen to anyone who wants a personal relationship with God through Christ.",Religion

From this single mistake, the one time Soames let passion rule, his life and the lives of his family and their descendants are changed in unpredictable and frightening ways. Galsworthy's theme is the constant tussle in life between property and art, love and possession, freedom and convention. In the fine tradition of family sagas, these themes play themselves out over and over with each generation.On another level, this is the story of an age, the story of the British Empire at its peak. Galsworthy packs his book with allusions to the great crises of the time, the Boer War and WWI, the rise of Labour, the death of the Queen, the spread of ""democracy."" The Forsyte homes are meticulously detailed, from the French reproduction furniture to the dusty sofas to the heavy drapes, to the fireplace grate, to the electric lights in the old chandeliers. Soames collects art, and Galsworthy showers us with the opinions of a British gentleman of the great and not so great art of the day. The Oxford edition is carefully footnoted, which can be distracting but for this novel, it adds a fascinating level of detail.The saga was written over a period of many years, and on yet another level I found the the changes in Galsworthy's style from the rather clipped, detailed recitations of events and commentary typical of the 19th century to the more expressive style of the 20th. Especially in the first volume of the three, family relationships are painstakingly laid out, the rounds of dinners and family gatherings carefully chronicled. By the third volume, To Let, Galsworthy reveals the love of the countryside and the pain of repressed emotions that the family members a generation ago would have hidden. The writing is very beautiful--as in this sentence: ""Fleur raised her eyelids--the restless glint of those clear whites remained on Holly's vision as might the flutter of a caged bird's wings.""The Oxford edition has an indispensable family tree and an interesting forward, as well as the extensive endnotes. Except for the family tree, these can be safely ignored if you like--the plot carries the reader swiftly along. It took me a good six weeks to plow through The Forsyte Saga, but it was worth it.",Fiction

B000PBZH6Q,Foundation,,,,1/1,5.0,995846400,Amazing glimpse of a not so distant future(in some respects),"Isaac Asimov captivates the reader in this book, the &quot;unofficial&quot; start to the Foundation series. The story revolves around 3 major characters, Hari Seldon, a famous psychohistorian and predictor of the Empire's demise, Salvor Hardin, mayor of Terminus, home planet of the foundation, and Hober Mallow, a Master Trader who rises through the ranks. I found the 3 separate yet interweaving storylines appealing, much like The Martian Chronicles by Ray Bradbury but not nearly as divided. Each character has their own opinion in how to accomplish a goal and presents each in a logical and realistic way. The thing that's amazing about the Foundation is that it doesn't have to rely on epic battles, hyperdetailed sensory imagery, or ridiculously long monologues by static, stereotypical characters. The characters are real, they get afraid, they make mistakes, and they change throughout the story. The writting is paced just perfectly so that it doesn't tire you out yet it provides enough details about any given situation. Asimov is a literary genius and I can't recommend the whole Foundation series enough to anyone who just has a little free time on their hands. And remember, &quot;Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent&quot; - Salvor Hardin",Education

The The first chapter talks about Nantucket and the way the entire town revolves around whaling. The husbands are away from home for months at a time, leaving the women to run many of the businesses and raise the children. Most of the streets were divided up depending on one's position in the whaling industry. After the Essex left Nantucket, I was surprised by how long it took for them to kill their first whale, which was near the equator. The book also discusses the conditions on the ship and how much affect the weather has on the ship and the crew's moral. Numerous little things could destroy the morale of the crew. After an intense rounding of the tip of South America, Henry Dewitt, one of the members of the Essex, deserted. The ship continued on, one man down. After a few months of no luck, they had a two lucky months and got 11 whales and continued heading west. One day, they spotted a whale so the the men got into the three whaling boats and headed after the whale. The whale damaged the boat that got there first so it had to return to the Essex for them to repair the boat. While the other two ships were still after the whale and the third ship was being repaired, a huge whale was spotted, and it was headed for the Essex. The whale hit the ship, knocking the men off of their feet, but that was not all. The whale swam away from the ship but only to turn back around and swim at the Essex twice as fast as it did the first time. The whale destroyed the Essex, leaving the men in the middle of the ocean with three boats. They filled the boats and collected supplies and discussed where they should head. The Captain, Pollard, wanted to head west to the Society Island, but Chase and Joy, the first mate and second mate, feared they would run into cannibals had they gone there. Instead, they proposed they head back to South America, and Pollard, lacking authority, agreed. After waiting for a day, the three boats left the wrecked Essex, heading for South America. They suffered from hunger, thirst, sunburn, and sores from the seawater. They found an island and stayed there for a few days, drinking water from a freshwater a spring during low tide and eating fish and birds. When they left, three of the men were nowhere to be found so they left them there. Once back in the ocean, Joy, who was in charge of one of the boats, began to feel sick and later died. Hendricks took over his boat. One night, during a storm, Chase&#8217;s boat got separated from the other two, never to reunite in the ocean. Shortly after, Hendricks&#8217; boat was separated and the men from it were never seen again. Men started dying frequently. ....

Centered in San Francisco, Washington D. C. and New York, WritersCorps is a program that encourages established poets to share their skills and motivation in improving the lives of economically disadvantaged youths. Having started in 1994, WritersCorps had a large field of poems to choose from and the quality and breadth of poems reflects its broad base. The poems do reflect teen issues such as young love, angst and struggles with authority figures, but they also reflect larger poetic issues such as love of family, nature and place in the universe. The quality of writing in this volume is very high. In addition, the volume is decorated with light grey backgrounds that vary from graffiti to faces. There is a strong introduction by world class poet Nikki Giovanni and quotations and poetic tips by famous authors throughout. With its strong, contemporary urban feel and high quality writing, Paint Me Like I Am is highly recommended for all poetry collections and should be strongly considered for any teen section.",Juvenile Nonfiction

I have assigned parts of the book to be read by my class at Northwest Indian College. I think the book sheds light on the backlash we see to the Obama presidency.

Don't get me wrong about McCourt's memoir of the Irish poor, but Lauralee Summer's oddly titled 'Learning Joy from Dogs Without Collars' has an extraordinary flair all it's own. When Lauralee Summer was at the age to enter college she never knew her life would make the newpapers and make radio airwaves nationwide. The headlines would read ""Homeless to Harvard"" and she even got interviews with the Boston Globe and other prestigious newspapers. When she was asked to make a network TV appearance, during the interview she was pressed for time, the host gave her only less than a minute to reply to the question: What was it like to be homeless? The short-moment media experience of her life in a nutshell prompted her to write the memoir.Summer's reveals in her memoir of a fatherless, nomadic-type life who lived with her mother who was known very little of being employed, eccentric---but loving and protective of her daughter. Summer and her mom were always on the move to one state or another. Life was far from easy of living in dreary, and even dangerous homeless shelters and delapidated welfare houses. They didn't own a car or a bank account and what little money they had wasn't enough for food or clothing. The sort of schooling Summer had she obtained here and there. And her joy came from learning to read and her love of books when she was a small child. It wasn't until she reached high school when she found the mentors she needed and a love for wrestling where she was accepted on the competitive all-male team! This was the time in life, Summer was able to move into her own acceptance. This would later build her foundation into the priviledged walls of Harvard. It was when Summer won a wrestling scholarship to Harvard, she was in the limelight of the press media of her unique story. Summer had come a long way from poverty and neglect, but everything paid off in the end. For everyone it always does in some way. Summer found her place in the world and made her own home. By constructing her life from the life of the streets and her Harvard education she is a mentor who paints a window of the dark, isolated and discriminating world of women and children in poverty. The house that Summer built was the one of a honest, courageous and compassionate heart who has found joy from dogs without collars.",Biography & Autobiography

Rold,2/2,5.0,1202428800,The Classic Text on Chart Reading,"Originally published in 1948, this book is absolutely one of the greats on technical analysis (i.e., using price action, volume and time). The authors claim that all a trader really needs to know is found in the charts. Fundamentals can be tossed aside. You just need to know how to interpret what the chart is saying and then act by taking a position.But does this approach work? This will depend on the individual. For example, you and I can trade the same stock for 3 years applying technical analysis but the end result can very well be that one of us ends up with a big profit and the other a big loss. The reason is due to the following factors: which patterns to take, the spot where you get in, how far to let a position move against you, and where to take a profit. As you can see, technical analysis is somewhat subjective.You probably know that there are no guarantees in the trading game. And chart formations are NOT infallible. All the stuff taught in this book will short circuit at one time or another causing a loss. You could even fall into a losing streak. Thankfully, the authors give fair warning about the dangers involved. But despite the unpleasant prospects, this book remains one of the very best places to learn the theory of technical analysis of charts. I recommend going with the 4th or 5th edition, that is all you really need to capture the essence of the material, plus, you'll save yourself a few bucks.",Business & Economics

There is a recipe for any type of bread you might want to make. Seriously. Want a recipe for Prune Bread? They've got it (okay, I admit I haven't tried that one, so I have no idea how good it is).My absolute favorite recipe in the entire book is their banana bread recipe. It is incredibly moist and dense. Any time my bananas start to get too ripe to eat I pull out this book and turn to page 543. When I'm in the mood, I've modified the recipe by adding about 3/4 C of pumpkin and a sprinkling of pumpkin pie spice.

Few writers can &quot;hear&quot; the music as well as he does -- and he somehow transmits this to the reader. Not content to be merely an historian, Giddins can also analyze a Charlie Parker solo with the best of them (as he does here), and his musical knowledge is formadible. He provides telling accounts and anecdotal information of the great jazz players and singers with great authority, a strong command of the language and an intrinsic love for this music.

Ramm,4/5,3.0,1328227200,"Never seen ""sperm"" so many times in my life","This is the tragedy of the whaleship Essex. The same tragedy that inspired Herman Melville's very famous novel, Moby Dick. Philbrick's In the Heart of the Sea situates the tale of the Essex in the history of Nantucket during the 1800s. Philbrick draws on the journals and personal testimonies of the survivors, local newspapers, etc. to recreate an event that had an enormous impact on American history and especially Nantucket history.The Essex set sail in 1819 to hunt sperm whales, which were the most oil rich whales in the ocean. The sperm whale gets its name from the stores of clear oil located in its head, which turns cloudy white when exposed to air; this oil burned clearer and brighter than any other whale oil and was in high demand. These whales could provide hundreds of gallons of oil, and one successful whaling expedition could make captains and investors incredibly wealthy.About 3,000 miles off the coast of South America the Essex is attacked and sunk by a vengeful sperm whale that looks to be about 80+ feet in length (double the size of the average male). In three small whale boats, the 20-man crew embarks on a legendary adventure. For 93 days they are stranded facing starvation, dehydration, and mental deterioration.The unspeakable things that happened during those 93 days are revealed through Philbrick's assessment of the history and the literature. He unveils not only the circumstances that would lead men to cannibalism, but also the circumstances that would lead men to temporarily abandon their morals and political and religious affiliations. For example, in the face of starvation they sacrifice a black sailor. This sailor is the first person to be killed for food; despite their abolitionist roots, the Nantucketers opt to save their fellow white sailors.Philbrick also focuses on the families of the sailors who stay behind on Nantucket as their husbands, brothers, fathers, and sons embark on two-year expeditions. Wives see their husbands for a few months at a time only to be left for years on end. Children grow to ages two and three before they even meet their fathers.Overall the book is a fascinating history of the lives of whalers, their families, and their native Nantucket. The history about the island has me itching to visit! My only complaint is that the book is a little dry and the numerous quotes and embedded quotes make for slow going. I've read two books while reading this one!P.S. I've never seen the word ""sperm"" so man times in my life.",History

Ever confused by the nuances of multiple inheritance? Ever wonder what XML or OOP or Relational Databases have to do with each other? Ever wonder if all those A.I. programmers in the 70s actually created anything useful? Ever wonder how type systems work? Ever wonder how to store complicated and vague data into a database?This book doesn't really have answers to these questions (nobody really does, in my opinion) but learning the information in this book is the first step you'll want to take to get closer to some answers...It basically covers 3 main topics: FOL (traditional logic like you probably learned in college) Frames (sort of the grandaddy of OOP) and Description Logics (a really powerful synthesis of object-thinking with strict logical fundamentals)This book has a bit of hairy mathematical notation in it, so if your not comfortable talking about things like ""an object x that is an element in the domain"" some of the chapters will require a bit of effort on your part. The authors are careful, however, to follow every difficult mathematical analysis with some concrete examples that ease the learning process- I often wish examples were more frequent in other theoretical tombs like this. Any computer programmer can process this text with a bit of moderate effort.I couldn't imagine being a professional programmer and not knowing the information in this book now that I have read it.

He writes very well indeed. These 13 stories, mainly about first-generation Jewish immigrants in America, but also about visitors to Italy from America, capture so much of life in a society where one is an outsider---that feeling of ""being here but not here"", or of living in a country, but not belonging. The wasted ex-coffee salesman, the harassed landlord, the loner rabbinical student, they all seem to pulsate with failure, with uncertainty, and fatal mistakes. Ah, this is a book about life all right, but it's a book in which the vision is almost tunnel vision. Every single story, without exception, deals with people who cannot rise to their own imaginations of themselves. They meet frustration, failure, death or disappointment, they are deflected from any purpose they might have once had. They are melancholy shades of fruitless endeavor. Does even one reach his ambition ? (They are all male.) No, the student doesn't find a house in Rome, the would-be art critic abandons his research, the would-be lover lies about his Jewish origins and loses the beautiful girl, the buyer on credit never pays back, the so-called reader never reads, the shoemaker allows his daughter to marry an unsuitable man. Only once, after humiliating an angel to tears, does an old man admit his mistake and save his wife from death, and this occurs in the only fantasy among the thirteen. Most of the characters lose, their labors come to naught, they grow wiser, but sadder. I would assume that Malamud himself felt an outsider everywhere, comfortable nowhere. If that is not true, his dreams must have been filled with worry, because this is a most melancholy collection. Does anyone smile ? Does anyone laugh ? Does anyone dash down the street radiant with love ? No. Life is full of personal shortcomings, a bald spot, a stubborn rejection of family, an inability to swim or make money. Frustration and lies run rampant--people certainly do shoot themselves in the foot again and again. Life is a tragedy, life always ends in disappointment-these are truths told in half the literature of the world, but there is more to our humble existence than that. Even when Malamud writes a humorous story, it is filled with underlying doubt in human nature, concentrating on the tendency of people to try to be what they are not. If you want thirteen superb stories to illustrate that sad point of view, here they are. If you think life is more of a mixed bag, then perhaps this book will only depress you.",Fiction

The chapters on musical humor--specifically Fats Waller and Spike Jones--are a revelation. Giddins has the ability to analyze a solo note for note and keep you enthralled; when you finally get the record, you hear it in a different way, for example Armstrong's Tight Like That or Coleman Hawkins's One Hour or Dizzy Gillespie's Manteca or Sarah Vaughan's Thinking of You, and dozens of others.

B0007EI15A,The Battle for Investment Survival,,A2GRXC6OCDSZH0,"Rob Ryley ""Robert""",74/76,5.0,1072483200,My cornerstone on speculation and investment,"I've read many recently published books on how to profit from the financial markets. Too many of them leave me feeling like I wasted my time and money.I decided to go back to the &quot;classics&quot;--Schabacker, Edwards and Magee, Graham, Hamilton, Rhea, and of course, Gerald Loeb.The more I read these &quot;classics&quot; of investment literature, the more I see the market hasn't fundamentally changed at all. All of those books have taught me something important, but I will always have Loeb's &quot;Battle for Investment Survival&quot; close to the top of my list.Loeb demonstrates he is fundamentally honest. Unlike most books, that get you to think becomming a millionare through daytrading is easy, Loeb teaches that there is no such thing as &quot;easy money&quot; in the financial markets, nor are there &quot;safe investments&quot; (bonds) as the value of money is constantly depreciating.He also teaches that there are NO guarantees, and that most people WILL lose money regardless of what they do. I think this is true, but most people cannot face it--even those &quot;efficient market&quot; types who advocate the buy and holding of index funds. (I believe Loeb would be a big fan of Exchange Traded Funds, however)So, what is one to do in order to preserve purchasing power? His answer: intelligent speculation and the ever-liquid account.To speculate intelligently, Loeb advises focusing on actively traded stocks--not illiquid &quot;penny stocks&quot; for your SPECULATIVE activities.Let's be clear--Gerald Loeb is no &quot;buy and hold&quot; advocate. Loeb could be considered an advocate of the &quot;relative strength&quot; approach--before the concept of &quot;relative strength&quot; ever existed.The moment your stock is failing to deliver superior profits, and you have no fundamental reason to believe its uptrend will continue, he advises you sell and look for another. If you can't find anything interesting, or the market is going down--you stay in cash. For Loeb, you MUST avoid catastrophic losses like those sustained in the crash of '29. A stock that doesn't rise (or fall if you like to short) is a waste to be avoided.Loeb is not a fan of too much diversification. He thinks it is a crutch that guarantees mediocre performance.His most important teaching would focus on money management (what we would now call &quot;asset allocation&quot;). Loeb would consider it foolish to allocate a significant (more than 50%) of your capital to stocks. You always need a cushion for those inevitable losses in trading operations.I've taken Loeb's advice to heart. His advice is even more applicable to options trading.By keeping a small amount of money in a volatile asset, and ruthlessly cutting losses, you give yourself a chance to match the market or even outperform, but with significantly less risk (volatility), due to the large cash reserves.Loeb's advice isn't easy to follow. But making money isn't easy. And by following Loeb's advice, I'm quite pleased.",Business & Economics

(And fancy finding out later that the bishop acting as the diocesan equivalent of a district attorney is himself a sexual predator)The charade of justice includes one in-court confrontation between Yvonne and her former tormentor that is most awkward and wrenching for having been played out before moral arbiters who are themselves as much in conflict with their own sexuality as the nun and priest on trial. The priest admits he broke his vows of celibacy, but remains oblivious to the damage he did to Yvonne as a human being and colleague in religious service. For him, ultimate accountability is only an issue of admitting to a moral lapse, receiving absolution and continuing on as a priest. While Yvonne, who tried to take a moral stand, in exposing the abuse done to her leaves the church that failed to back her in that stand.When I was eight years old, I saw the movie &quot;Song of Bernadette&quot; and became enchanted with the idea of becoming a nun. But after reading Yvonne's heart-rending memoir, I know that as long as the Church retains these wolves in sheep's clothing who call themselves priests, I'd rather take my chances walking down a blind alley at 2 A.M. in a drug-infested part of town than play guessing games with wondering who's really a good priest and who's not!",Biography & Autobiography

A society epic, a romance, a satire, a character study, and a concept examination (of the effects of beauty on people's lives), the Forsyte Saga tells many stories but centers on the tragic marriage of Irene and Soames. Irene has married Soames under duress from her stepmother, and she detests him. Soames views all things in his world as possessions, including Irene. The tragedy of this marriage begets more tragedies among other characters who swirl into and out of the narrative. Other, unrelated tragedies in the Forsyte family dovetail with Irene and Soames's as we come to know a great number of aunts, uncles, sons, daughters, and cousins. But ""The Forsyte Saga"" is not all heavy; many of the characters are terribly funny (what could be better than senile aunties?), and Galsworthy's comments on society are acutely witty. Galsworthy draws his characters so superbly that when the books first came out, readers wrote to him claiming that he must have based characters off of acquaintances of theirs. Galsworthy's prose is elegant, fluid, and sparkling with energy, making ""The Forsyte Saga"" beautiful and very readable, despite its heft.",Fiction

It has been listen to so much that the tape is worn and in bad shape. You have to have full volume to even hear it sometimes. I remember sitting in the car listening to it rather that going inside some place with my dad. The song playing was about Isabel the pig. &quot;Isabel is a pig with a ring in her snout. You can dress Izzy up, but you can't take her out. She will jump in the middle of a big muddle, because Isabel is pig.&quot; All the trappings in the world, don't look pretty when you act like a fool or put on a pouty face.My favorite song is &quot;The School of the Fool.&quot; The guy in the song was &quot;A first class, A+, student in the school of the fool.&quot; He was mean, lazy, etc.&quot;Go to the Ant&quot; is really a well known saying from the Bible. It is also something we should be paying attention to. The ant doesn't have a boss looking over her shoulder. She does the work anyway. She works all day. Not like us. Some do may be, but most work a five, six, seven, eight, nine hour shift. Not from son up 'till sun down. &quot;Are you responcible? Do you ever do a job without being told to? Or are you the lazy kind? And you mother and your father always have to scold you?&quot; &quot;Go to the ant, observe her. See how she works all day. And she doesn't even have a captain to tell her what to do, but she works hard anyway. Go to the ant, and listen. Tell me does she complain. She is God's illustration of organisation. God made her, now you immitate her. Go to the ant.&quot; &quot;Well, there was a poor irrisponcible sluggard who slept when there was work to be done. Too late he realized his foolish behavior and poverty struck him like a man with a gun. Go to the ant.&quot;I still find my self singing the song about the seven things God hates. &quot;There are six things, even seven, that the Lord, that he cannot stand: Proud looking eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood, a heart that thinks of wicked things to do, feet that run to evil do, anyone who loves to lie about others, and one who causes trouble with his brothers.&quot; &quot;God hates things that we should hate too.&quot;&quot;From the lips of the little ones, he has ordained his praise.&quot; &quot;You made man a little lower than the angels, put things under his feet.&quot;&quot;Talk to me. Show me that you care. Talk to me. Listen to what I say. Talk to me. There's so much we can share. I know you love me when you talk to me.&quot; &quot;He always takes the time to talk to me.&quot;I remember times when I didn't care much for Christian music (didn't know much about it either), the music was too dull, but (little children music it may be), music like this appeal to me ten times what the rest did.The beats great, the words are not only great, but (sorry to about half the bands in the world) they are understandable. The message is clear and it is clearly benificial rather that to your potential downfall as some music now a days is.I highly recommend this tape, whether you are getting it for a little kid like my mom was, or you're getting it for yourself.

0192834193,As You Like It (Oxford Shakespeare),,A1ARA52HB238HT,"Matthew M. Yau ""Voracious reader""",2/2,5.0,1124668800,"""Sweet are the uses of adversity.""","AS YOU LIKE IT presents itself as a comedy but more substantially a spiritual meditation of one's conversion to goodness. While the play retains conventionalities that resonate in his other comedies, Shakespeare had obviously nudged the play to a direction that is redolent of a religious overtone. The main plot concerns Rosalind, a woman who disguises as a man but pretends to be the woman she actually is so she can woo the man by teaching him to court her. A streak of melancholy runs through the play from the beginning when Orlando is bitter at his brother Oliver who has deprived him of a genteel education and retains him at home. The melodrama of the brothers presages a possible tragedy as Oliver proposes to burn the lodging where Orlando customarily lives and with Orlando in it.Diversion away from the city and court somewhat mitigates the tension. Far away in the fairyland-like Forest of Arden (allusive to Eden) resides a banished duke whose crown and lands his brother Frederick has usurped. Duke Senior, in his landmark opening speech in Act 2, which introduces the allegorical Arden, duly expounds the pastoral philosophy. He articulates the monologue so well that the phrases become proverbial and the speech a sermon. Most of the actions then occur in Arden and in which almost all of the characters converge. Arden in a way represents a religious ideal and a converging ground for everyone to renew their identity and spirituality.As Orlando flees from his villainous brother, Rosalind's venomous uncle Duke Frederick banishes her from the court to be with her father. Rosalind enters Arden disguised as a young man Ganymede and teaches Orlando about wooing. Whereas the woodlands of A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM are genuinely magical and populated by fairies, the Forest of Arden is like a fictitious realm that represents an ideal in which social values, love, marriage, and identity are renewed and re-examined.Shakespeare contrived to make a tale of redemption or some sort of a moral lesson out of AS YOU LIKE IT, preaching the ideal pastoral philosophy through the de-emphasizing of the plot. The story does not seem to matter as much as the underlying moral theme Shakespeare determined to convey. While Rosalind plays a leading part of the play and peremptorily takes charge of the play's situation (which facetiously involves entangled love among multiple parties), she extorts the necessary promises from all concerned and ties the right knots. Her preponderating overshadows Orlando despite the initial stress on his manliness and valor.AS YOU LIKE IT is predominantly in prose: the opening scene that delineates Orlando's pent-up agony proceeds in verses so does the scene in which the usurping Duke dismisses Orlando and that in which he banishes Rosalind. The scenes involving the banished Duke, who delivers a tirade on pastoral philosophy in Arden, are all written in prose. It is not a coincidence, but rather a meticulous choice that the sober and solemn parts of the play are penned in prose.Variation of theme that manifests in different plays again surface in AS YOU LIKE IT. Rosalind, whose disguise is already a Shakespearean convention, in teaching Orlando how to woo, speaks about the caprice of human heart, the failure of lovers' to keep in pace with emotions, and the conflict between impulse, feeling, and truth.AS YOU LIKE IT could be easily one of the most canonical plays in the repertory owing to the fact that readers can lay claim to the text on their own behalf. The endless possibilities to interpret the play also ironically invite misleading account from focusing on only selected features. The famous line ""sweet are the uses of adversity"" cunningly sums up how in most comedies a near tragic crisis at which disaster or happiness may ensue could be overcome by such overriding force of goodwill.",Juvenile Nonfiction

Why?Cecilia Martin documents many abuses, justified by their proponents as &quot;reform,&quot; currently assailing the Church. She shows how enemies hijacked the genuine reforms of Vatican II and selectively misinterpreted them to promote an agenda aimed at its destruction. Far fetched? Read the book! It is well written and referenced. Reach your own conclusions. If they are the same as Cecilia's, follow her advice on how to counteract this attack from within.",Religion
0681994851,Jane Eyre,,A1SEBQEDHJFS9S,&#34;Kindle Addict&#34;,2/2,3.0,1330646400,Problems with this Kindle version?,"I'd give the book itself 4 or 5 stars, the 3 star rating is because this Kindle version is a little flawed.'Jane' is sometimes spelled 'Janet' which is a little annoying, but not that bad.One thing I'm unsure of is whether or not this version is incomplete on place names... I kept seeing -shire and things like that, but sometimes the name of the town was complete. Since this is the only version of Jane Eyre I've ever read, I don't know if that's an error or if Bronte intended it that way. ???The book itself I'm glad to have read. It is a good story. I think some of the negative reviews by readers who didn't like it are influenced by the fact this book was written over 150 years ago. Writing styles have changed drastically, as have social norms. I got used to Bronte's way of speaking and it flowed better after that. Glad Kindle has the built in dictionary too. There are just a few passages of dialogue in French that you might want to translate, there are plenty of free translators online that would probably do well enough. I personally think it's possible to pass over them without knowing their meaning; they aren't crucial to the story. As far as the social themes, some of Jane's dilemmas wouldn't have been dilemmas in today's society but I suppose they were huge issues in the time period of the story so you have to think of them that way and think about how someone dealing with her set of circumstances then would handle it, not how you or someone in today's society would.Bronte was quite the author. Very descriptive, great use of analogy, etc. And in this day and age it's nothing for a female as a child or a woman to stand up for herself, speak her mind, and wish to be an equal, but I kept reminding myself this book was written in England in the mid 1800s... it must have been revolutionary at the time.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""",1/1,5.0,1275782400,As he liked it,"Out of all the great Shakespeare's plays, ""As You Like It"" is undoubtedly... the fluffiest. This is cotton candy. Fortunately, cotton candy isn't too bad as long as you don't eat too much of it. And while the ending is excessively tidy, ""As You Like It"" is a charming little play with the full array of Shakespearean tropes -- transvestitism, love triangles, and mass confusion.Backstory: The cruel Duke has deposed his far nicer brother, and the ex-Duke has run off into the Forest of Arden. At the same time, a young man named Orlando has been cast out by his cruel brother Oliver.Then the Duke decides to exile his niece Rosalind, despite the pleas of his daughter Celia. So Rosalind (disguised as a boy), Celia and the jester Touchstone run away into the Forest of Arden the following night, and soon encounter the exiled Duke and his followers. So does Orlando and his faithful servant Adam.Because of a previous meeting, Rosalind and Orlando are already in love. But not only does he not recognize her, but because she's disguised as a boy she's attracted the amorous intentions of a local shepherdess. And to make matters even more complex, Touchstone is in a love triangle of his own, and Oliver has stumbled into Arden as well. Is everything going to end well?The biggest problem with ""As You Like It"" is the fact that the ending is just a little too tidy -- while it's plausible that the romantic tangles would be smoothed out, there's an conveniently-timed twist that stretches believability to the point of snapping. Fortunately, the rest of it is a pleasantly fluffy little story filled with Shakespeare's sparkliest, sunniest storytelling.Shakespeare's plot floats along in a heady cloud of sunlit forests, poems pinned to trees and languid outlaws who hang around singing all day. His lines are filled with clever, sometimes bawdy jokes (""praised be the gods for thy foulness! sluttishness may come hereafter"") and some nicely evocative imagery (""Between the pale complexion of true love/And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain"").The funniest parts involve the love quadrangle between Rosalind, Phebe, Orlando and Silvius, as well as Orlando's wretched poetry and Touchstone's mockery of them (""Winter garments must be lined,/So must slender Rosalind"").And it has a likable cast of characters, most of whom are amiable and likable (although I'm still not sure why Orlando and the ex-Duke don't recognize Rosalind!). Celia and Rosalind are fun and sprightly heroines, Orlando is an endearing underdog (if a rotten poet), and there's also the sharp-tongued Touchstone, dour Jacques, and the rather beyotchy Phebe.""As You Like It"" is a puffy little wisp of a play, compared to Shakespeare's other works -- but it's still a nice little romantic diversion.

Although perhaps I might have known it from the title, this book is not about the fitness you will need for daily life. This book is about how to build an exercise program in order to adore yourself in the mirror. I personally find that thought revolting, so the book isn't really for me. That said, ...This book does a good job of outlining a flexible exercise program that can easily be adjusted to meet anyone's needs. It outlines the basic muscles that need to be worked. Then, each program has slots for each muscle group. So, fill in an exercise for chest muscles, another for ham-strings, etc. From the standpoint of building a program, this may be the easiest and simplest book I have come across. This is also the only book I have seen that actually treats women's issues in particular. Things such as time of the month, or pregnancy, can affect how your exercise program works. Unlike other books, this author has recommendations for dealing with those issues.The author also recommends using the mirror to determine what goals you wish to set for yourself.What is not in this book are the why's: why this program versus that one. Why should I do three sets of 8-12 reps, and when should I (if ever) switch to sets of low reps? When is my program okay, versus when should I change it and how? I mean, the three exercise program outlines are likely to get old quickly. Likewise, Schoenfeld offers only one program during pregnancy, and no insight on how or why to vary it for variety and safety--only that his must be followed to be safe.Knowing what I do now, I would not buy this book again.

B000PBZH6Q,Foundation,,A35CIFO1KX5EMS,Michael Legg,1/2,4.0,991267200,Introspective and thought provoking.,"Foundation is the first book of Isaac Asimov's aptly named Foundation Trilogy. Foundation presents the premise that when examining large enough populations of people it becomes possible to predict their behavior stochastically (and sociologists become statisticians). The great psychologist of the day, Dr. Seldon, finds from his statistical data that there is going to be a great social collapse; and he creates two colonies (or foundations) that are designed to shorten the period of chaos the universe will experience before a renaissance occurs. Without giving too much away, this novel is the story of the early years of one Foundation and its' experiences with the universe around them. This book makes one wonder just how much people act of their own volition and exactly to what extent we are all the same. Is it possible to predict the behavior simply by examining a large group? Another interesting sub-theme with this book that I found extremely interesting is that eventually there won't be any original thoughts; the example given is of archeology; the archeologists of Seldon's age assumed that there was no point in examining ruins; they simply read books written by the archeologists of earlier generations; it was assumed that there was nothing else to find.

The ownership and increase of property being their main goal in life they are inevitably troubled by affairs of the heart which they cannot control and which make no rational sense to them. The once solid family is torn apart by love and all the hard work which has gone into getting and keeping their property ends up being for nothing.The way the conflict between the emotional impulse for love and happiness and the capitalist instinct for aquiring wealth is told by the author is an absoloute triumph!

Are you sure?,"I thought this book was for men...later i understand what this was about. I have to agree that most men are so stupid that yes some of these techniques will work for them. But let me think about something. Women do not approach guys and especially in cold approaches. SO this is about men in their social circle who women find attractive and they want to have a relatiosship with them (If they just want sex they only have to show them that they like them sexually - and when i mean sexually i mean it - Not the miserable girl that beg with their manners for 50 dates after sex , but be a little playful sluty ). In case of relationships attraction is not a choice. If you like him, you like him and this is the end. If he is so pussy to go for what he wants then maybe by applying theese manners you may intrique him, especially if he is young.But is this an authentic man? I dont think so.The real man goes for what he wants and he approaches women - if he doesnt get her he goes for another one. He is not so emotionally involved in the beggining (as many women are). He begins to be emotional after sex (Im talking about a real man - observe it and you will see that i am right)What is important in the begginnig is the appeareance. Fix your body (the height doesnt count in most cases)Hit the gym,Then go to a place where they are men, and just be near them (I understand that you will not open them (its the ego and it is ok if you are a woman). (Clubs - coffe shops - parties - places with rock music) ANd do not go with more than 3 friends -> its so difficult .I also have to say that these techniques work also from men to women (most of them who have success with women do these things unconsioulsy - since its about women that they can find easily. A hot woman has the more apporaches. She doesnt need these tricks . As also hot men do not need tricks (most of them)If you want a serious relationship, let him take the control.Even when he goes for other women he will return to you. Most men want many women - Its in their dna, and this is the truth. This is not bad since they do not get emotionally involved as they will with you. They dont have to love a woman to make sex.This is what happenes and that why the hot men have so many women that they behave as jerks.Another think i have noticed is that not so good women (fatty and miserable) have a lot of insecurity and wait for the perfect one (Brad pitt clone). Yes this happen to the most ugly girls ironically. The most hot women do not care so much about appeareances but only about sex, fun and security - and thats why they like them.If you are fat you have almost no chance with a hot male (and fotget the alpha male)You have to understand that a man is not a girlfriend with a penis. He likes football, women , work and socializing. He is not albe to speak like a woman.On the other hand if he has no humour - stay away from him, no matter how hot he is. He is a stupid man beyond the men circle.Read the books: How to become an alpha male + Bang to get the idea",Family & Relationships

Now we can move on to the inexcusable other 90% of the material.I read this book in a fit of desperation one evening, emotionally weakened by lack of sleep and in need of the same mindless entertainment and self-affirmation that conducting a late night Google search of your own problem can provide. A friend told me it was a ""good"" book.No! No, no. This book has the worst advice I've ever heard and completely contradicts the idea that two people can communicate effectively, ever. I've tried to scrub my mind of the residue from all of the author's horrible advice but one nasty piece comes to mind -- pretend you can't do anything physical around the house, then ""ooo and ahh"" over how strong your husband is for something like hammering in a nail? Ladies, s*** like this is condescending and completely insincere. If you value your husband or know him at all, surely you can dig out a real compliment on a quality he's actually proud of.Another theme to ignore if you want a decent guy in your life is the idea that you'd better just clam up when you're angry --to teach him a lesson. There is a term for this, it's called passive-aggressive behavior, and it's a psychological problem that couples go to therapy to try to STOP doing.The author wrote this book for profit, which often requires sensationalism, and against that I have no complaint. However, I was too embarrassed to have this title staring me down from my iPad every time I opened the Kindle app, so I deleted it from my account.

If you only take away a few principles from this book it will pay for itself many times over, if you study it and use it with dedication you will eventually become a millionaire through smart investing. Gerald Loeb was a top broker for E. F. Hutton and also made a fortune in his own account. He opened my eyes to very important concepts and made them clear. For one, stocks are for selling, people buy them so they can later sell them for a profit. So what we are looking for is simply a stock that others will buy in hopes of a future profit. A stock's prices do not top out at the height of the underlying businesses fundamentals, they top out when expectations for the the future is the highest. We should not look for a $1 profit on a thousand shares of a stock it would be better to look for a $10 profit on 100 shares. We should not even risk our capital on a stock unless it has the potential to increase by at least 50% in a reasonable time maybe 12 months. Do not over diversify for portfolio he agrees with Warren Buffett that we should but all our eggs in one basket and watch that basket carefully. It is actually safer to invest with companies you know inside and out. Buy a stock by starting with a small initial buy, if the stock goes up by more, but only buy after your first purchase makes you money, if it does not sell because you were wrong. This is a small taste of the wisdom this man has given us with his 40 years of experience. This book was originally written in 1935 with its last update coming in 1965 its wisdom is priceless and timeless.

I first made a country-style bread that combined whole wheat and bread flours with a touch of maple syrup, and it was yummy. I'll be trying one of the Italian semolina bread recipes this weekend for an Italian dinner party. But my favorite so far has been the Vienna bread. It is best while still warm from the machine (slathered with butter, if you're feeling naughty). It is fairly dense for a white bread, makes great sandwiches, and keeps well for several days. I haven't yet tried any of the biga (starter) breads, but I am looking forward to them. I wish the book contained a cinnamon-raisin bread recipe that was *not* gluten-free; I'll have to improvise.The instructions in this book are clear and very easy to follow. I also appreciate knowing which recipes are suitable for use with the delay timer. While some ingredients are hard to find, plenty of the recipes call for readily available items. I've discovered that the vital wheat gluten required in most recipes is available at my local Safeway, as are Red Star yeast and semolina flour.The fact that vital wheat gluten is *not* the same as wheat gluten flour is mentioned in the book, but not emphasized strongly enough. Also, I have to remember to add salt along with the liquid ingredients, although the recipes list salt with the dry ingredients, because my bread machine manual states that salt can interfere with the action of the yeast if it comes in contact with the yeast too early. Perhaps this is a possibility unique to my machine (a Breadman Ultimate). I agree with an earlier poster who complained that recipes using the Dough cycle (for breads to be baked in an oven) call for unplugging the machine at the completion of the cycle; this seems unnecessary.Overall, I am pleased with and inspired by this book, which contains a great amount of useful information and a slew of easy and delicious-sounding recipes!

0394779959,Summer of My German Soldier,,,,5/5,5.0,1173916800,The Summer Patty Bergen Would Remember that One Special German Soldier,"The most exiting event in the history of Jenkinsville occurred that summer day when a Prisoner of War camp was set up just outside the city. The Nazi's that had been depicted as evil people that would kill someone as soon as they looked at them turned out to be young, kind-faced men with blond hair. Patty Bergen was Jewish and her father owned a department sore on the main street of the town. One day she was in the store when the prisoners with money in hand came to buy hats for work in the field. Patty went to help one of the prisoners whose name was Frederick Anton Reiker and discovered that instead of wanting to buy a hat with his money he wanted to buy a pen with fake diamonds on it. Not long after their first meeting, Anton escaped from the prison camp and fled but before he caught the back of a departing train, Patty saw him and invited him to stay in the room over the garage until the war was over. But, one day Anton saw Patty being beaten and he ran out to stop the attack, but Ruth, the housekeeper saw him rush out from the garage. Even though Ruth would not tell a soul about it Anton decided it was too much of a risk on Patty's part and he left that same night. After Anton had been gone for months a man named Mr. Pierce asked Patty a fair amount of questions and after hearing that Anton had died she let everything out. After that she had to go and live with her grandmother for a while until the time of the trial. The judge sentenced her to no less than four months in a reformatory for girls and there she stayed for the time. I enjoyed this book because of how the story of how it was depicted.I thought this novel was quite engaging because of how Patty changed over time. At the beginning of the story Patty is reckless and had low self-esteem. Her sister was always getting compliments on how pretty she looked, and Patty was always being told that she should try to look and act more like her sister. After Patty started hiding Anton she took baths and started to care more about how she looked. Also Patty started getting beaten by her father often and she sometimes thought that she was always wrong. Then after Anton died and she was sent off to the reformatory school she developed a new perspective on life and people. After Ruth went to see her she discovered that she was not wrong, but did things for the right reason in a way that other people could not see.The way that Anton acted throughout the entire story was completely unexpected for what most people associated with Nazis. Anton, unlike most of his colleagues spoke virtually flawless English and was a very polite young man. Even after he found out that Patty was a Jew he continued to treat her with respect and he cared for her deeply. Also, Anton did not join the Nazis because he wanted to he joined it to escape punishment and imprisonment by his own country.I also enjoyed this book because it showed the level of tolerance between the Caucasian Americans and the people that surrounded them. Ruth was the African American housekeeper for the Bergens and if any food was missing Patty's mother always assumed that it was Ruth without using any logical reasoning to see if one of her own children had eaten the food. Even though the German prisoners were not mean or unruly they were usually treated fairly but once they were out of earshot news about them spread quickly. One of the things that the townspeople said about the prisoners was that they were being treated too kindly and that they should have cruel punishments.Through reading this book I gained an appreciation for Patty because of how she gained confidence though the story. The imagery of this wonderful novel created an amazing story with brilliant characters. This book was also wonderful because of how Anton was shown in the story. The novel was especially good because of how racial and cultural differences play into each other.R. Roston",Juvenile Fiction

Piazza approaches each of the tracks individually, often providing stop watch-timed musical analysis--allowing the reader to first read and absorb the technical explanations and then playback the track and engage in focused listening exercises.""Understanding Jazz: Ways to Listen"" is geared towards musically-trained readers eager to add to their knowledge base the intricacies of jazz music--it is not a book for those without any prior knowledge of music theory and terminology. Piazza also succeeds in bringing to life the music through creative use of analogies, thus going beyond explanations of the discussed recordings.

In her clear and unapologetic style, she helps hurting wives take themselves to God with their pain and losses. He is the source. Then we can allow Him to teach us the way out of despair and selfish grasping, and see the way to walk through adultery, addiction, walls of hostility, and get to the other side.If you have been looking for answers, and found yourself dissatisfied with 'divorce recovery' or 'abuse recovery' or 'tough love' approaches, and wonder why they have not taken away the ache for family healing deep within you, then you have come to a good alternative.

B000PBZH6Q,Foundation,,A2YF4ZMECJVLK9,D. Cloyce Smith,1/1,4.0,1083283200,A psychohistorical futureworld inspired by Edward Gibbon,"In a preface written in 1982 for a volume collecting the original ""Foundation"" trilogy, Asimov recalled the sources of inspiration for the series and boasted, ""Why shouldn't I write of the Galactic Empire and of the return of feudalism. . . ? After all, I had read Gibbon's 'Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire' not once, but twice.""Edward Gibbon's influence is certainly obvious in ""Foundation."" A galactic empire, centered in Trantor (a celestial Rome), is on the verge of collapse. During the Dark Ages that follow, the surviving remnants at the extreme borders of the galaxy initially maintain control by creating a religion that hides scientific knowledge behind theological mysteries and by training a caste of priests to monopolize this learning. Asimov, however, goes beyond the period covered by Gibbon (who ended his masterwork with the age of the Crusades): when new and powerful rulers challenge the priestly authority, an upstart mercantile class--the Medicis and Borgias of the galactic future--gain the upper hand.Yet ""Foundation"" is hardly a history lesson; Asimov simply channeled his understanding of medieval and Renaissance Europe into a series of intriguing stories, what might instead be described as ""psychohistorical"" and sociopolitical thrillers. In the opening chapter, during the dying days of the Empire, Hari Seldon studies ""psychohistory""--a kind of societal (but not individual) determinism based loosely on the idea that broad historical trends are cyclical and predictable. Aware that he cannot prevent the fall of the Empire, Seldon uses his learning to chart a course for the preservation of knowledge and an accelerated re-creation of a Second Empire. (Asimov had no way of knowing, of course, that psychohistory would later become a legitimate field of academic research by such scholars as Peter Gay.)Each of the five episodes in the book reads like a tautly played game of political chess in which the winner is inevitably the visionary who is not wedded to traditional moves and who is patient enough to wait for his opponent to make the first mistake. The suspense is developed almost exclusively from the ""cold war"" tension between rival forces: there's not much action in ""Foundation,"" and (as other readers have noted), the lengthy dialogue is spotty and the ""character development"" is pretty much nonexistent (although the same could surely be said about such sci-fi classics as ""2001"" and ""The Time Machine""). But if you like your science fiction a tad cerebral, you'll find much to admire in Asimov's first major work.",Education

This is the reality of Jane Eyre, a young orphan girl forced to cope with the callous world around her as a child. After the death of her parents, Jane is forced to reside with her cruel aunt, Mrs. Reed, who despises her, and consequently sends Jane away to Lowood, a boarding school with little resources and poor housing conditions. Despite malnutrition and a harsh atmosphere, Jane strives to make her mark at the school, eventually becoming a teacher. Before she realizes it, Jane tries to escape from her old life and embarks on a new journey as a governess under the employment of a secretive and guarded gentleman. As Jane falls in love with her mysterious employer, she struggles to safeguard the little confidentiality she has left to protect herself from the secrecy and ill-will of others. Although Jane cautiously guards her heart instead of exposing her soul, a revelation of truth eventually catches up to her, causing more harm than the wrath of the deepest secrets. Jane finds herself trapped between truth and lies as she faces her past, her situation, and herself in a world where all odds are against her. Jane Eyre has remained a classic in literature because Bront illustrates the necessity of secrets in life, therefore supporting the tendency of human nature to occasionally slip in a guilt-free secret or two into one's life.",Literary Criticism

From a unique perspective of being a world authority on Mahayana Buddhism, he compares key aspects of the two religions and offers solid rationale for his choice.

The clarity of his thinking and his willingness to offer personal anecdotes and insights make this journey with Dr. Williams extremely rewarding. He includes much relevant philosophy and theology without his writing ever becoming dry or losing the reader's interest. For myself, as a former Buddhist using this book during RCIA, its greatest value is as a work of apologetics -- a coherent, rational, original, convincing, and not to mention quite beautiful argument for and defense of the Christian and Catholic faith, warmly and lovingly written.

B000PBZH6Q,Foundation,,AWLFVCT9128JV,"Dave_42 ""Dave_42""",15/18,3.0,1109635200,Still A Classic,"This is the first of the three novels in the original ""Foundation Trilogy"". The trilogy is similar to ""I, Robot"", in that the novels are created out of shorter fiction that was first published in ""Astounding Science Fiction"" in the 1940's. It was first published in novel form by Gnome Press in 1951. A trimmed down version was published under the title ""The 1,000 Year Plan"" by Ace books in the 1950s.While certainly a classic and important to setup the series, ""Foundation"" is easily the weakest of the three novels. Consisting of five parts, four of which are taken from the shorter fiction from years before, it covers a large period of time in a relatively short amount of space. In addition, the stories are fairly short, and it is rare for a character to appear in more than one. As a result, there is little in the way of character development in this book. The subsequent novels (""Foundation And Empire"" and ""Second Foundation"") are each comprised of just two works of shorter fiction, and thus do not suffer as much in this area.The sections of ""Foundation"" are:""The Psychohistorians"" - This is the story of Gaal Dornick who has come to the capital of the Empire, Trantor to work with Hari Seldon. This story introduces the key concepts of the series; introducing the reader to Psychohistory, the Empire, and the purpose of the Foundation. It is unique among the sections of this book, in that it was written specifically for the novel and was not published previously.""The Encyclopedists"" - In this story, the Foundation becomes separated from the Empire, and is threatened by its neighbors, the Anacreonians. It is in this story that the citizens of the Foundation find out their real purpose, having believed before that they were sent there to create a Galactic Encyclopedia to preserve man's knowledge. This was first published in part as the novelette ""Foundation"" in ""Astounding Science Fiction"" in May of 1942.""The Mayors"" - This story is closely tied to ""The Encyclopedists"", and there are some of the same characters. Once again the Foundation is threatened by the Anacreonians; however, this time the Foundation uses its technological expertise to avert the crisis. This story also introduces the use of `Priests' to spread the influence of the Foundation. This was first published as the novelette ""Bride and Saddle"" in the June 1942 edition of ""Astounding Science Fiction"".""The Traders"" - This story is about the use of trade to expand the influence of the Foundation. More specifically, it is about an agent of the Foundation who has been imprisoned on Askone, a planet that prohibits the use of the Foundation's devices. This was first published in the October 1944 edition of ""Astounding Science Fiction"" as the short story ""The Wedge"".""The Merchant Princes"" - This is a more complicated and involved story than the others included in this book. A merchant trader, Hober Mallow, goes in search of several missing Foundation ships, discovering evidence of the old Empire. More important though, is the struggle for power within the Foundation which results in the abandonment of religion in favor of economics as the source of expanding the influence of the Foundation. This was first published as the novelette ""The Big And The Little"" in the August 1944 edition of ""Astounding Science Fiction"".The trilogy has been recognized by readers and critics alike over the years. In 1952, it was rated as the 15th best book overall by the Astounding/Analog All-Time Poll. It moved up to 12th on the same poll in 1956, and then to 1st in 1966. In 1975 it was ranked 6th on the Locus poll for All-Time Novels. In 1987 it was 6th on the same poll for SF Novels. In 1998 it was ranked 4th on the same poll for novels before 1990. It also received the 1966 Hugo for All-Time Series, beating out Tolkien's ""The Lord Of The Rings"", Smith's ""Lensman"", Heinlein's ""Future History"", and Burroughs' ""Barsoom"" series for the award.",Education

Philbrick recounts the disaster of the Whaleship Essex largely relying on a careful selection of accounts from the memoirs of First Mate Owen Chase and Boatsteerer Thomas Nickerson that are peppered with interesting and informative annotations from a wealth of other sources.Clearly the author has an advantage in writing about such an exciting and well documented story, but Philbrick sets himself apart in that he lacks the pretension and glibness of many contemporary historians. For example, nautical terms are used throughout, but not in way that is mired in the nitty-gritty (although the notes provide additional depth) and a clearly labeled illustration is quite enabling for the ""coof"" (off-islander) or layman reader. Furthermore, the numerous asides do not disrupt the story, but enhance it due to the thoughtfulness and subtly of the author.This is an excellent and enthralling book from a most perspicacious author.

I was hoping to read a novel that would provide me with some rich insight into the history of El Salvador. Instead, I was given an unoriginal family drama that could have really taken place anywhere. Although the book does use a realistic description of El Salvador as its BACKDROP, there was nothing in the writing that gave me any striking details into the economic or political history of the country or its people. Unwanted pregancies, cheating spouses, backstabbing friends, unrequited love...its all been done before. Just because it all takes place in El Salvador doesn't make it a historical novel.I also wasn't overly impressed with the writing. I guess it was technically adequate, but definatley not very sophisticated or poignant. Nothing in the book made me stop, put it down, and think. Nothing stuck with me. As a student of Spanish I also thought the author way abused the Spanish phrasing. She should learn to use it sparingly, and only when there is something deep to get across.

B000PBZH6Q,Foundation,,A2LJ3AURXJLRUC,Mike Kenny,0/0,5.0,1352678400,Foundation,"Foundation, a collection of five short stories, is the first book in Isaac Asimov's epic century-spanning science fiction masterwork known as the Foundation Series.The first of the collected stories, ""The Psychohistorians"", takes place on Trantor, the capital planet of the 12000 year old Galactic Empire. Mathematician Hari Seldon has developed a new science known as psychohistory which equates are possibilities in large societies to mathematics, allowing him to predict long-term outcomes. Using his psychohistory, Seldon discovers that the Galactic Empire is decaying and that it will collapse within 500 years, the collapse being followed by a 300000 year period of barbarism in the galaxy. When his findings are declared to be high treason, Seldon and a group of hand-picked scientists agree to go into exile on the planet Terminus, where they intend to create a mammoth Encyclopaedia Galactica as the repository for all human learning. In this way they hope to limit the period of chaos that will inevitably follow the collapse of the Empire.In ""The Encyclopaedists"", having progressed 50 years into the future, the planet Terminus is facing its first Seldon Crisis. The Foundation on Terminus is caught in the middle of a power struggle between four neighbouring planetary systems and the scientists are ill-equipped to deal with military matters. Luckily, Mayor Salvor Hardin is quick to realise the danger and attempts to work out a solution. Hardin receives guidance as to the way forward for the Foundation from an image of the now deceased Hari Seldon that appears in a specially created Time Vault and confirms that psychohistory has predicted a series of crises that will occur on Terminus.""The Mayors"" takes place 30 years later when the Foundation has used its scientific knowledge as the basis for a pseudo religion that keeps neighbouring planets in order. However, the Prince Regent of Anacreon seeks to overthrow the Foundation and so Salvor Hardin is once again called upon to avert a Seldon Crisis.In ""The Traders"" another 55 years have passed and a trader by the name of Limmar Ponyets is sent to the planet Askone to retrieve a fellow trader who is facing execution. The leaders of Askone are determined to avoid contact with, and contamination by, Foundation technology so Ponyets must employ devious methods to secure the release of his colleague.The final story is ""The Merchant Princes"". The Foundation has expanded and grown powerful through the use of its science religion and economics but three Foundation vessels have recently disappeared in the vicinity of Korell, a civilisation trying to develop their own variety of technical superiority. Trader Hober Mallow is sent to uncover information on their technology and hopefully find the missing ships.Foundation is clearly an epic undertaking, especially since anyone who reads this first book is pretty much guaranteed to want to progress on to the further books in the series, but it is well worth the effort. The Foundation Series is perhaps more esoteric that Asimov's Robot Series but is still a rewarding read. The characters, planets and indeed empires that Asimov has created are truly immense and his storytelling ability is outstanding. Foundation is a fantastic book by one of the greatest science fiction writers of all time.",Education

0681994851,Jane Eyre,,A1VF0102Z9VITO,Joseph M. Reninger,0/0,5.0,1348704000,Classic for the best reason!,"One of the challenges in reading a great work of literature is that it often has many imitators. The imitations may be flattering or unflattering; they may be complimentary or subversive; they may borrow just little bits or just about everything. In addition to spoiling surprises (thanks a lot, I Walked with a Zombie!) it is possible for the original source to look cliched or hackneyed after experiencing all those others. Did that torpedo this book for me?Consider some various elements in the story: The first conversation between Jane and Helen Burns at Lowood School reads like the best of Dostoyevsky. The plot meanders from location to location across England like the best of Dickens. Jane has romantic entanglements with noblemen and churchmen (it's Church of England, after all) like the best of Austen. Ghosts, crazy people, and supernatural/horrific events pop up like the best of Val Lewton.Jane Eyre does not suffer at all by comparison. The story of the orphaned girl growing up in an unloving home with an indifferent aunt and cousins, moving out to a harsh boarding school where she gets her education, and taking a job as a governess at the lonely estate of Mr. Rochester is compelling reading. Her character grows throughout the book in believable and engaging ways. There are many deep conversations about Christianity, duty, missionary work, matrimony, etc., that fit naturally into the story and arise from the people's lives. I found the book fascinating and hard to put down. This is a great work of literature undiminished by other similar works.Thanks to Julie and Scott at A Good Story is Hard to Find for getting me to read this wonderful novel.I did read the book on Kindle for Android, which means I didn't really have a book. Unfortunately there was no annotations or notes and quite a bit of dialogue is in French (with a small bit of German, too). I remember just barely enough to get through but it would have been nice to have translations available. I don't know if other e-versions have better support for language-challenged readers. It is something to consider if you haven't read Jane Eyre and don't know French. I think a reader could get by without it but it can be frustrating.",Literary Criticism

Meggs,0/0,5.0,975715200,4 wives and 6 children in 5 months,"Owen Chase, the first mate on the whaleship Essex that shipped from Nantucket in 1820, to be visciously attacked and sunk by a sperm whale over 2,000 miles from the South American coast, survived at sea on a whale boat for two months. Cannabalism of a dead crewman was his key to survival. Chase subsequently became a whale boat captain and authored a tome on his experiences. In 21 years at sea, Chase only spent 5 months on land but managed to have 6 children by 4 wives (2 died in childbirth, 1 was divorced for infidelity while he was at sea). This history book, though highly entertaining, is an eye-opener about 19th century America, Natucket Quaker culture, the whaling industry, race (when the survivors resorted to cannabalism, the first four crew members eaten were Americans of African descent, a face that the Quaker abolitionist whalers of Nantucket tried to keep silent). The literature that came out of the Essex tragedy, from Melville's Moby Dick to works by Edgar Allen Poe, is also well reviewed.

As some have said, and as I apprehend to be somewhat true over the years, a diversified portfolio are for ones that don't know what they have as a diversified portfolio tends to let the losers run, and teases one to take early profits on the winners.Mr. Loeb is not totally anti buy-n-hold, just that he advises that one should spend more time on studying and trying to find a more sure, or statistically possible, big thing verses just hoping for market averages. As Mr. Buffett ascribes, one should only have twenty (20) punches and use those punches very wisely. If so, and if followed, then toss in some Charles Munger and some Kelly Optimization and bet big.Is this method for all, probably not, but the experience Mr. Loeb provides should help all to both become better investors and evaluating advisors whom ascribe their sometimes suspect knowledge that really is a veiled sales pitch.

This is the story of the actual events that inspired Herman Melville to create his novel, Moby Dick. In the Heart of the Sea is the story of the whaling industry in Nantucket, as well as the culture of the people of Nantucket. Most of all it is a story of how men faced with what seems to be insurmountable odds against them, strive with everything in their heart and soul to survive and return home. The lengths these men of the sea would go to and the actions they are forced to choose between were stunning. The author describes their physical and mental condition as their situation plays out and you realize what a super-human effort even the smallest necessary task was to perform. To fight when your body has nothing to draw upon or to surrender yourself at that point, these are the decisions they must weigh. The author recreates the emotions at each point in their journey. From the ramming of the ship, when the men cannot believe what is happening, to their isolation on the sea, thousands of miles from the nearest land in small boats and a meager supply of survival supplies, to their arrival on an island, only to realize they cannot survive for long there either. The documentation of the starvation process from other situations (concentration camps, remote crash sights, etc.) provide a crystal clear story of what these men were experiencing. While the first chapter or so did not pull me into the story, suddenly I was swept up in the lives of these whalers and could not put this book down. If you want to read about the sea or what men can overcome when life is in the balance, this is a vivid tale, tragic, heroic and stunning.",History

It is a useful textbook but offer little challenge to the religious precommitments that the reader may hold.This volume is a bit dry as it covers religious antiquity, classical times, and modernity. It lays out in a straightforward manner the religions of Egypt, China, India, Greece, Near East, Far East, and the West. The volume finishes with the great monotheistic faiths: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. There is a lot of discussion of essential doctrines, rituals, and culture within this acceptable introduction to comparative religions.Herein one will learn about vital elements of:- Prehistoric religion- Tribal religions in Asia- Early Australasia- Traditional Africa- Aztecs and Mayas- Andean religion- Northern Europe in the Iron Age- Mesopotamia- Ancient Egypt gods- Ancient Greece pantheon of gods- Ancient Rome- Ancient Iran- Hinduism in its diversity- Jainism- Sikhism- Buddhism- Judaism- Christianity- IslamI as a stout Christian do not endorse its assumptions. I affirm an exclusive view of the person and work of Christ. Carroll noted: ""If you don't know where you are going, any road will take you there"" (Lewis Carroll).-------------------------------------------------------I would add: A tale is told of a very artistic spider that built a beautiful and awe-inspiring web; it was a wonderful work of art. Many came to see its magnificence and symmetrical splendor. It was engineered with great precision and complexity. The little spider was glad that his work astonished so many. This motivated him to keep good and exact maintenance over it. Correspondingly, he would tighten a cord here and there, and then strengthen a string on the other side. One day, he noticed a large thread that didn't look useful. So, he cut it with his fangs, and as he bit through it, the whole web collapsed; and the little bug fell to the ground. The thread that he had just cut was the one essential thread that the whole web depended on. Once cut, it collapsed. Similarly, the Triune God is the grounding thread for a coherent web of beliefs (presuppositions). Those who reject Christian theism will tumble down into absurdity. The God of the Bible alone provides the foundation to attach a worldview that is both beautiful and enduring.I contend that Christianity alone provides the rational and moral necessities for intelligibility. That Christianity must be presupposed to make sense out of human experience. The non-Christian world religions deny Christian truth and leave the adherent into irrationality and disapproval. All men behave in rational and moral ways. However, only Christianity can account for the laws of reason and moral absolutes on which morality depends.The only ground for the necessary pre-essentials of the transcendent, atemporal, universal, and immutable laws of logic would have to be able to account for these pre-essentials by furnishing a ground, as Yahweh does, that is transcendent, atemporal, universal in knowledge, and immutable. A capricious monad god, Vishnu within polytheism or Poseidon within the college of gods do not offer these pre-essentials; and all the false deities fail to provide the rational and moral preconditions that Christianity delivers.""What do I love when I love my God? Not the sweet harmony of song, not the fragrance of perfumes, not manna or honey, but when I love my God, I love a certain light."" (Augustine).An epistemological ground that contains universals, changeless forms, and moral law cannot be overturned by appeals to experience. It deals with the required pre-environment to make experience intelligible. Since the laws of logic and fixed moral law are necessary to make experience intelligible, one cannot appeal to experience that is in constant flux to undermine them. Intelligible experience presupposes the laws of logic. Thus, A is A (Law of Identity) and A cannot be A and Non-A at the same time in the same manner (Law of Non-contradiction). What can supply the preconditions for these laws? Yahweh alone. No other deity has the attributes, the ontological essence, and epistemic credentials to supply these preconditions.""I believe that all roads lead to the same place. We're taking different ways to get there, but we all end up in the same place. It's kind of like Kinky Friedman's statement, ""May the God of your choice bless you""' (singer Willie Nelson).""Ned, have you thought about one of the other major religions? They're all pretty much the same (Lovejoy from"" The Simpsons).The vital task of the thinking person is the task of criticism of falsehoods and rational inconsistencies. Many in the West believe that all religions are wacky myths or that they are all basically the same. This is prima facie not true and is self-refuting. Even the ultra-tolerant Newsweek magazine in 2007 admitted that ""it is a fantasy to imagine that the world's two largest faiths (Christianity and Islam) are in any meaningful sense the same."" Hindus, Newagers, Buddhists, and multifarious atheists believe that all religions are essentially alike; on the contrary, the religions disagree on almost every religious question. Christianity teaches that one is a sinner in need of a Savior and one is saved by grace through faith alone. Buddhists and Hindus believe that this world is an illusion. Buddhists focus on liberation from suffering and the self. Islam believes that the Trinity is false and that one must obey Allah to gain Paradise. Religion and anti-theism have fueled many wars and conflicts in history. Most multiculturalists deny that religions and cultures are dissimilar and incompatible. They insist that tolerance is the key to everyone ""getting along."" Some aspects and doctrines in diverse religions are similar. The entire field of world religions, but one (Christianity), profess that one has to work to merit his salvation or religious goals. It is believed to be possible through God's grace conjoined with the contribution of religionists. Christianity is the only religion that denies this proposition. The Christian faith alone contravenes the notion that salvation is grace plus works. One is saved by grace alone inasmuch as Jesus died on the cross for His people's sins and rose from the dead on the third day. All of the architects of various religions died and stayed in their graves, except for Christ. Newsweek added that it is a shibboleth that ""all religions are the same.""This magnificent volume explains the doctrines, myths, symbolism, and rituals of religions past and present.",Religion

In the Dark Ages of Northern Europe `wolfshirt warriors' (Ulfhednar) the stealth oriented companions to the dread Berserkers; the Knights Templars, an order so secret that their history is still debated; the Cult of Assassins (Hashishin); and of course Japan's elusive Ninja all practiced the `Art of Invisibility'. The Japanese Ninja became so adept at collecting and perfecting methods of stealth movement and fighting that theirs became a martial art unto itself.In Ninja Shadowhand; The Art of Invisibility, Dr. Haha Lung and Christopher Prowant explain the basics of seeing. We learn how our eyes work, and gain an understanding of how shape, silhouette, movement, and color effect what we see and what we don't see. We also learn about point of view, obscuring a foe's perspective, and psychological blind spots.After explaining how we see the authors show us how we may apply this knowledge in martial arts applications. This is explained through the basic application of ukemi, misdirecting attention and disguising movement.Ninja Shadowhand then mentions `shadow weapons' such as the yawara (short stick), manriki (10,000 power chain), shuriken (throwing star), and application of modern hidden weapons such as the handkerchief, lapel weapons, and walking sticks.Ninja Shadowhand will not turn you into the invisible man.

Beliefs, values, and movements associated with the 1960's, argues the author, have had far greater influence than is generally realized. Above all, the volume seeks to explain why American society has gathered so much hostility at home and abroad over the last quarter century. Why have critiques of American isnstitutions and policies proven so durable?Hollander show that contrary to much popular and journalistic opinion, the rejection of American society conceived during the 1960s have been absorbed into the mainstream of American life, making it more dificult to distinguish between the dominant and ""counterculture."" Gradually and almost imperceptibly, the entire political spectrum has shifted to the left and meanings of ""radical,"" ""liberal,"" ""conservative,"" and ""moderate"" have been redefined. Much social critism - examined in detail in these pages - has become highly standardized and is now embraced by important social institutions such as colleges and universities, churches and foundations, and much of the media. Special attention is paid to groups engaged in the articulation and circulation of such critiques: intellectuals, church leaders, journalists, academics, and some politicians. While emphasizing continuities, Hollander also traces differences between the social critism of the sixties, the seventies, and the eighties.--- from book's dustjacket",Social Science

B000I83ZJC,The Forsythe Saga,,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""",4/4,5.0,1244505600,An unending family,"Family secrets, dirty little problems, gambling, divorce, illegitimate babies and a dash of adultery, scandal and forbidden love. Soap opera?Not exactly. It's Nobel Prize Winner John Galsworthy's sprawling family epic ""The Forsyte Saga,"" a three-volume saga that spans the nouveau riche Forsyte clan, and the devastating events that threaten their ever-respectable facade. Galsworthy's lush writing and intricate, insightful stories are excellent on their own, but the dignified handling of 19th-century laws and mores -- and how they changed -- add an extra dimension to his writing.While it has a distinctly soapy flavor, ""Saga"" retains its dignity and look at turn-of-the-century mores and society.The Forsyte family is determinedly regal and hard-nosed, almost to the point of a fault. And as the story begins, the Forsyte family has come together to celebrate June Forsyte's engagement to a young bohemian architect, Philip Bosinney -- except for June's father, who eloped with the governess and is now shunned by his family.Among the guests are the stuffy, domineering Soames Forsyte and his quiet, unhappy wife Irene -- though she conditionally agreed to marry him, she doesn't love him. But Soames regards Irene as his most valuable piece of property, even as she begins an ill-fated affair with Bosinney. At the same time, the patriarch Jolyon starts to kick off family disapproval, and goes to see his estranged son.Soames' determination to ""own"" Irene leads to tragedy for all three of them, and Irene and Soames separate for the next decade. But when Soames demands a divorce so he can marry a French girl, he finds himself obsessed and stalking Irene once again. And as before, Soames' harassment drives his estranged wife into the arms of another man -- his disgraced cousin Young Jolyon. And even as Soames gains a new woman, he finds that you don't get everything you want...A new complication enters the works almost two decades later -- Soames' daughter Fleur is immediately attracted to Irene's son Jon. The two start an innocent romance, unaware of their parents' past together, but still overshadowed by the loathing and shame Soames and Irene have for each other. An aristocratic suitor for Fleur, mysterious letters and a secret love affair all come to the surface, as Fleur and Jon discover that love isn't always enough to overcome the bitterness of the past...The Forsyte Saga is indeed a saga -- it stretches from the stuffy Victorian era into the first bloom of the roaring twenties. Despite the early claim that Forsytes would never die, various characters age, die and weave new lives for themselves, and grapple with a rapidly changing world -- including the new rights for women as individuals, rather than ""property.""The first part was written in a time before the world of England's upper crust changed forever -- sort of an English ""Age of Innocence."" And while Galsworthy's first trilogy can be seen as the story of an obsession, it can also be seen as the portrait of the Forsytes overall -- stuffy, gilded, and eager to forget the working class roots a few generations back.Galsworthy paints this time in a flurry of lush, dignified prose , filled with slightly mocking notes about the Forsyte family, and tiny gestures and expressions that convey more than actual dialogue could (""Huddled in her grey fur against the sofa cushions, she had a strange resemblance to a captive owl"") and lushly written descriptives (""... over the lush grass fell the thick shade from those fruit trees planted by her father five-and-twenty years ago"").Yet there are touching moments too, like Old Jolyon paying a visit to his estranged son and his lower-class second wife, and the grandchildren he has never met. The awkwardness, love and pain in these scenes is truly astounding.As for the main characters of this drama, Galsworthy handles their passions and involvements delicately and with dignity. No soap opera dramatics -- just a married woman in love with her best pal's fiance, and who is raped by her angry husband. And then a realist's version of ""Romeo and Juliet,"" if Romeo and Juliet's parents were exes and no suicides came into it.Soames and Irene are really at the center of this book -- she remote, quiet and something of a mystery even to the readers, and he a selfish, close-minded man who wants to ""own"" people. Their children are far more endearing -- Fleur is passionate and vivacious, and Jon is sensitive and sweet. But there's a vast cast of interesting characters in the Forsyte family, especially melancholy Young Jolyon and his artistic daughter June.Bitterness, obsession and love fill the pages of the ""Forsye Saga,"" and provide the start of a truly classic trilogy of great novels.",Fiction

Its okay if one is unable to read continuously, because one knows their secrets and stories will keep, and every bit of gossip and story will be saved for the next installment. Galsworthy's story literally leaves the reader hungering for the rest of the story.Why? Galsworthy brillantly reveals the strengths and weaknesses of each of the primary players. While he exposes Soames arrogance and pride, he also reveals Soames confusion, denial, and disbelief, thereby humanising the otherwise 'man of property.' When Irene suggests to Soames the option of dissolving their marriage before they have married, that is, if she is unhappy, one is prompted to read on, carefully, for the clues that explain and support how this might occur.Indeed, this is an oldie... but like a fabulous dessert, it is worth the wait.",Fiction

Herman Melville actually went over to Nantucket to talk to the captain of the boat. I was pleasantly surprised when I found myself engrossed in the author's first hand accounts.

It was a bustling town peopled with the women who ran it and their children. The men who were whalers, were rarely home. They would be gone for two to three years at a time only to ship out again after a few months of being home. Later on it is noted by the author how similar this lifestyle was to that of the whales which they hunted. The circumstances which surrounded the eventual destruction of the Essex are fascinating. This is followed by a series of mistakes made by the captain and officers which eerily reminded me of the Titanic's sinking almost 100 years later.

It's Not Perfect But I Wouldn't Go That Far,"Having bought and/or read a number of books in this vein, Copan's work seems to be accessible and understandable by the lay person, yet at the same time offers enough depth for the person interested in deeper treatments of various subjects. The chapters are brief enough to keep the average person interested. I would recommend it as a primer for the non-academic who wants an introductory treatment of critical worldview issues.I do have an issue with ""Ben J""'s review of the book and its mischaracterisation of Copan. After browsing his other reviews, it seems he doesn't like ANY of the Christian books he's reviewed and seems to include the same hyper-critical elements in most of his reviews - as if he's working from the same template for all of them (including the non-orthodox position that the Bible teaches that everyone, Christian and non-Christian, will be saved, which runs absolutely contrary to the orthodox Christian position that has been held for 2000 years. How Ben pulls that out of Scripture is beyond me. The fact that Copan disagrees with that view makes Ben attacks his work. But I digress.....). But specifically here, his accusation that Copan's attitude in this book is to preach some message of ""win the argument over the 'poor pitiful non-Christians' at all costs"" is so offbase that it seems to me he threw that in there to mischaracterise Copan and throw the on-the-fence person off from considering it as a reading possibility.On the contrary, Copan takes great pains, starting even in the first couple chapters and repeating it throughout the rest of the book, to talk about how Christians must conduct any discussions of critical issues in love and respect for other's viewpoint and always seek to build positive bridges between themselves and those they are trying to reach. ""Ben J"" read the book (at least I think he did), yet he can't see that. So it seems to me that Ben's problem is that he just doesn't want to see it at any cost, so he'll mischaracterise the book and the author with wild straw-man statements in the hopes that the unsuspecting reader will be convinced that Ben knows what he's talking about.Get a copy of the book for yourself and then draw your own conclusion as to whether I am right on this or Ben is right.

Each feature new to SP2 is flagged with an icon in the text, so it is easy to pick out additions to the system. My opinion is that if you cannot figure out how to do something by following the steps illustrated in this book, then you may be untrainable.Not all of the steps in a sequence are shown each time. For example, clicking the start button, the first step in many of the sequences, is not demonstrated after the initial section. The author assumes that once you have done it a few times, it does not have to be explicitly demonstrated. After that, there is an ordered list of steps on one side of the page and a screenshot with numbered arrows pointing to the item to be examined, clicked or filled. The simplicity of it all cannot be understated, I occasionally use it as a reminder. When I can't remember the sequence of steps to complete a task, I reach for this book and turn to the appropriate page. In most cases, within seconds, my memory has been jogged and I know what to do.",Computers

So far I've made 3 recipes from the book - a flax seed bread, beer bread and a whole wheat bread - and they've all turned out amazingly well. I was resigned to the &quot;fact&quot; that bread machine bread was more dense than grocery store bread - until I tried these recipes. The bread is light and moist and the crust is crispy and delicious. I haven't bought the SAF yeast, I'm using regular bread machine yeast but it doesn't seem to matter. I admit - because I'm from Canada, apparently our flour is different from US flour - that I modify the recipes a bit - reducing the flour by 1/8 to 1/4 cup. I've also found that I can reduce the amount of sugar and fat called for in the recipes and still have excellent results.This book is wonderful and I would recommend it to anyone with a bit of knowledge of baking and a desire to spend some time with their bread machines.",Cooking

0394779959,Summer of My German Soldier,,,,21/27,4.0,912988800,Couldn't put it down,"In my opinion the is a heart-wrenching, though provoking book for mature readers. Usally I don't read dramas but when i picked it up I couldn't put it down. The main character Patty Bergan really becomes a part of you. This book focuses on love and hate set in World War II in a swall town in Arkansas. Patty has just turned twelve. She is a young Jewish girl who is nelected by her parents and alone until she meet an excaped, German prisoner of war from a compound near by named Anton. Even though this is set during wartime America this book remindes us who read that there is good amoung evil, and that even in the darkness, there is light. For a lot of people this book can be somewhat painful because of the victimization of children-- wheater the brutality is physical or emotional. Anton excapes from the local prison and Patty, knowing the rick, helps him to hide. She lived with perpetual fear of maternal rejection and redicule-of her vicious, child-beating fatherand of coming in a poor second place to her pretty, petted sister. She also knew the rick of her norrow-minded Arkansas town opposing her humanitarian treatment of an excaped German prisoner of war. Patty learns to look at Anton, not as Nazi, but as a frightened young man. Patty knows that if anyone were to find out her life would be over, but cannot overcome the power of love. With Anton, Patty finds the love she has longed for and the appreciation her parents never gave her. Such a friendship can be dangerous. In Green's scenario of paranoia and government promoted prejudice, there is no room for compassion or the budding of a romance. Even pure friendship is tained by vicious minds. The ending was sudden and shattering. I would recomend this book to anyone.",Juvenile Fiction
1580627560,Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship,10.85,A2IB3MX588JDGF,Steven Alexrod,25/53,1.0,1142208000,A Man's Actual Desire -- Not Some Theoretical Inkling of What a Man Wants,"I heard and read the fuss over this book and a woman I knew gave me her copy (I will have more to say about her in a moment). Many women not only seem to think this book is disturbing to men but have said so outright and with some misguided, idiotic sense of one-upmanship satisfaction. Indeed, I think many women after reading this, will have their anxieties greatly provoked, given what they are thinking men find appealing about women.The basic premise is that men do not respect women who have no life. Well gee wiz, Sherlock Holmes! The author says a woman needs to ""hold her own"" in a relationship, and many women on here and in conversation have taken that to just men they have a proverbial entitlement to b*tch and moan whenever things don't go their way. Wrong baby. You can whine all day and night but an entitlement to what exactly? ""Holding your own"" to a man is what you can bring to a relationship, if he is actually considering being with you in one. Any by what you can bring I mean in terms of support, economically, socially, emotionally, psychologically, and in terms of interests and skills. Unless a man is some Donald Trump type, then a college educated man today is looking for a woman that is genuinely intelligent, reasonably educated, can bring financial support to the relationship, has an actual career, preferably an interesting one, and yes of course a physically attractive woman as well-one articulate and emotionally grounded. Now any of these things will prove variable depending on the man and his own status in life, and if he is a Donald Trump, then brain and education are bottom on the list and you better be young and have killer hot looks. But that is a rare extreme.Again, most educated men are looking for intelligent career women. It is not something that is ""hot"" or ""sexy"" or some fetish to us. It is what is expected in this day an age, coming on the heels where many of us have seen our father's slave economically as the sole ""bread winner"" and out mothers, who worked hard in their own right, had it much easier, all while feminist said ""daddy"" was suppressing mommy. I can tell you my father would have loved to have had a wife that worked and helped support the house economically and not just domestically (which my father supported domestically as well). I am not impressed in women doing now what men have for many decades down for family and country. Now that women have the opportunities (and some can argue more in some respects) as men, it isn't something to be applauded for since this is old old news. Indeed my mom did start to work in industry late in life, around the time when my siblings and I were going off to college (I'm 30 now). For a woman today to think that having a job or career makes her special is just utter narcissistic folly and in all probability the ""career"" is what a robot could do. No man will ever find that in and of itself fascinating or worthy of greater respect. We men have been doing this for generations, so you are not impressing us coming on the playing field we largely created and still outshine you on. Being and education and having a job are base minimums.After education and career status, men are seeking for a real individual. Some other male review mentioned this already and he was dead on. Today's women are a dime a dozen. Many, even in their 30's are trying to emulate other women, buying gaudy, hideous, and expensive shoes and book bags that leaves a man seriously confused over what the appeal is. Many of you dress the same, talk the same, act the same, and think that still you are different from the endless masses. To a man seeing you, all he'll recognize is that many you have blue eyes from green eyes, are a blonde instead of a redhead, and perhaps a bit more chubby than his previous more sports active girlfriend, but that is where the differences end. These are physical differences and subtleties, which soon will lose their appeal if there isn't anything more substantial at play. Do you have a genuine personality? Or is your only sense of self giving some hackneyed reply of ""holding your own?"" Exactly how? How can you distinguish yourself from all the others who believe and say the same thing? How does that make you stand apart from them? It doesn't. You are just part of the white noise and background.It is ironic, for just a few short decades ago women bemoan how they wanted men to desire women of substance. Now that men do, women are reverting to all the past feminine and sexually exploitive stereotypes that women of previous generation would have avoided. One wonders then just how far women today truly have come as a whole.What makes a man not just respect a woman but desire her? Is it her body? No. That is lust. Is it her mind? No. That is just fascination. Is it her career? No. That is just an incidental interest. What makes a man fall if love and respect a woman is the same thing that makes a woman fall in love and respect a man: his sense and knowing of self, reliability, commitment and dedication, empathy, and most of all-despite having a life that he could live separately on his own, shares it self-lessly by bringing and giving love to his partner and family. That is what makes a man. And that too is what makes a woman-for it what is being human is about. You don't have to be a Ph.D. to know this or read a book written by one showcasing that suffix at the end of her. And if you think that a pretty shoe, or this book bag, or that career or that thing you do that you believe makes you so unique will set you apart in his mind and earn you his respect or love-you are greatly mistaken and know nothing of men today or yourself for that matter.As for the woman that had lend me her copy, she is an attractive woman who works in advertisement. She makes good money. But she is a clueless materialistic clone-minded self-centered woman that is believing that the world revolves around her and mistakes this belief for ""holding her own."" When she asked me out, I politely turned her down. I am not looking to waste time with women like her and know what I want in a woman and she wasn't it by a long shot. Love is making yourself open in being first open with yourself. That is what makes anyone fall in love with another, and sadly this woman didn't have that openness.",Family & Relationships

This richly textured American Book Award Winner, is a sort of rich man, poor man, upstairs, downstairs, set in El Salvador from 1932 through 1977.It is a compelling read and Sandra Benitez grabs the reader and transports her to El Salvador with the first sentence:""The parakeets ascened in a rustling roar of wings from the amate and primavera trees. Chattering rowdily, they hailed the rising sun. They flew toward the southern sea cresting in a line of shimmering foam tha broke and then evanesced along the black volcanic shore. The birds wheeled, banking in a long graceful turn before heading back over the forest they had roosted in; they soared toward breakfast in maicillo fields twenty kilometers away. Jabbering, the birds glided and dipped over the alluvial plain furrowed by rivers and streams coming down from the highlands. Across the plain, they trailed a hasty shadow over squares of cattle ranches and rectangles of scattered farms; they sailed past the spot where four hundred years before, don Pedro de Alvarado and his conquistadores defeated the mighty arm of the Pipil. But such a victory exacted its toll for in the fierce skirmish, Alvarado took an arrow in the leg, a wound from which he would never recover.""And that wound to the leg portends the history of the characters which inhabit Bitter Grounds. Sandra Benitez fleshes out her heroines of each generation, Elena and Mercedes, Magda and Jacinta and Florencia and Maria Mercedes. All are strong and vulnerable, wise and foolish and all are haunted by decisions that will shape their paths and those who follow them.The familiar structure of the family saga worked well to bring an understanding of the mid-twentieth century history of El Salvador. Sandra Benitez, skillfully fleshed out the intricacies of the culture, the economy and social structure of the country for a reader unfamiliar with it can gain understanding and insight, while at the same time entertaining with a wonderful story. She infused her story gracefully with small elements of magic realism which inhabit many books by Latin American authors.I would not hesitate to pick up another book by this author.",Fiction

It isremarkable that he wrote the Foundation while a young man, barely 20 I believe, a work with grand themes and the cornerstone of his massive and sprawling future history of mankind, which I believe went into more than 50 volumes. The basic plot is that a scientists created a new discipline, psycho-statistics I believe, that could predict the future behavior of huge masses of humans. He then attempts tomold - or at least influence - man's fate over the next 30,000 years. What is truly amazing is that Asimov succeeds in this and the two following volumes. In a way, he should have stopped here with the series. The ideas are crisp and not yoked into a determined framework, so are fresh with lively characters. Later novels in the series - the overwhelming majority - feel more stilted, bound by concepts more than by a plain old good story.A sci fi classic.",Education

I would like more depth. There just wasn't enough information about any of the NRMs. And the author sounds like he wants us to respect, honor and love them all as if they were each beloved children. Hogwash. He is right to try to provide understanding, and show that there is no reason to hate these NRMs or anyone involved in them. But he just goes farther than I think he should, and farther than anyone should. After all, some of these NRMs have proven to be downright tragic, if not evil. And personally, I extend that all religions, old and new, big and small, aminstream and alternative.Also, he almost completely ignores one of the biggest NRMs ever - the Mormons. Why? Were they too successful?

There are several chapters, such as the evolution of plants (Campbell get his Ph.D in botany), that can easily be passed over.

There are a lot of things the military isn't telling Pres. Bush (but what would he know about military life, anyway?) This is a place where soldiers routinely get drunk, many smoke hash or even shoot drugs, and heterosexual promiscuity is rampant. And may you find mercy if you're even suspected of being gay.Even so, Hatheway felt relatively safe for a time as he met other gay men discreetly for sex at his unit in Bod Tolz, Germany, and elsewhere. Homosexual activity, he found, was more common than he first thought. Gays still had to be careful: there were several really gung-ho men who got wacked out about them. But if you didn't get caught, it wasn't all that bad.Unfortunately, that's what happened to Hatheway. Just days before he was due to be discharged, an enlisted man invited him to his room for a drink. A bottle of scotch later, they found themselves in a sexual situation. Nothing unusual, until one of the man's roommates barged in. Hatheway's entire future blew up before his eyes.His careful recounting of the subsequent ordeal is fascinating, particularly his allegations of military misconduct in the prosecution of the trial. If true (and we have no reason to believe they aren't), they're deeply disturbing. Hatheway was lucky he didn't end up at Leavenworth. Instead, he became a successful professor of German history at a college in Wisconsin.Someday America's gays and lesbians will be able to serve their country without having to sneak around. Look for it to happen in about 2025. But it may take a couple of generations after that before the American military stops treating them like it did Hatheway.

IN THE HEART OF THE SEA: The Tragedy of The Whaleship Essex is a well written tale of a shipwreck, all the more absorbing because it's no 'fish story' - every word is true. It is history and also travelogue; a drama of human survival; it tells of Quakers, Wampanoag Indians, English settlers and free blacks; we learn all about sailing on the high seas, the whaling industry, and what life was like on Nantucket.A visit to the whaling museum in nearby New Bedford shows how economically important the industry was to the area in the past. It was also culturally significant, providing the background for one of our greatest novels - Herman Melville's MOBY-DICK. The Seaman's Bethel mentioned in MOBY-DICK is still there, just across the street from the museum. The story of the Essex provided Melville with the idea for his main character - not Ahab, but the whale. Not only Melville. Philbrick uses two accounts by Essex survivors - first mate Owen Chase and cabin boy Thomas Nickerson - as sources. He weaves them together with his own writings on the sea and knowledge of Nantucket to provide us with a harrowing but immensely readable tale.Although the central tragedy in this book tempts us to make bon mots such as this being a book that 'you can sink your teeth into', this trivializes it. There are no Epicurean feasts here. The repast that the men sustained themselves on was something not normally considered palatable. After being shipwrecked, they survived by feeding on human flesh; they were forced to resort to cannibalism. Unlike Moby-Dick where the sinking of the ship was the conclusion of the story, here it only marks the beginning of the real tragedy.The Essex was rammed and sunk by a Sperm whale, going down in the South Pacific. Philbrick tells of how the 20 man crew of the Essex made it into three small whaleboats which they were able to rig with sail. The nearest land were the Marquesas Islands, about 1,200 miles due west, with the prevailing wind. Due East, against the wind and 2,000 miles away was South Amerca. The men decided to head East. That they did so is understandable only in the context of the times and the thinking of the men. Philbrick says plainly, that because of Xenophobic fears and belief in rumours, the officers of the Essex were convinced that the unknown island inhabitants of the Marquesas were cannibals. There was nothing to fear about South America. Heading toward mainland set them on a three month voyage that in a cruel irony of history would see the very thing that the men feared the most - cannibalism - becoming a reality, at their own hands.Philbrick's tale of survival at sea, the desperate situation these men found themselves in, and the final acts of self preservation that they were forced to resort to, is a pretty grim acount. Nevertheless it is a 'can't-put-down' powerful and poignant story and an example of why popular history is so...well, popular.",History

This book is a waste of paper and ink.There are several things about this book that greatly disturbed me.First, this book is blantantly unbiblical. Most of the things in this book have no basis whatsoever in Scripture. This book is perfectly named. It contains nothing more than worldly wisdom and the author's often absurb interpretations of Scripture. It twists the teachings of Christ and Scripture to an almost unbelievable degree. Scriptures are often taken out of context and used to support man-made ideas.I had high hopes for this book. A non Christian friend has asked some questions that I don't know how to answer. So I hoped this book would help me find the answers. Suffice it to say, I was very wrong.It also concerns and grieves me that bible scholars such as Ravi Zacharias and JP Moreland have endorsed this book. Surely scholars of this caliber should be able to recognize the many unbiblical teachings in this book.Many Christians are so guillible today.

0801063833,That's Just Your Interpretation: Responding to Skeptics Who Challenge Your Faith,18.24,AKI8VJIO9GF4M,S. F. Bell,1/1,3.0,1302998400,Could Be Better,"In this book Paul Copan offers apologetic responses to twenty-one different criticisms of Christianity. Written in a clear, informal style, each chapter includes a summary of its major points and a short list of further reading. Copan writes from an evangelical perspective but generally avoids taking a hard line on issues like inerrancy (he accepts Big Bang cosmology and doesn't believe in a literal six-day creation) and the theory of evolution (which isn't really discussed). He adopts the ""worldview"" perspective that's been popular in Christian apologetics in recent years, in which most people are seen as falling into a number of broad belief system frameworks. However, Copan is not as rigid in his portrayal of these worldviews as some other apologetics writers. For instance, many evangelical writers crate an elaborate portrayal of a ""naturalistic"" worldview, claiming that its proponents are essentially extreme nihilists, and making little more than a straw man argument with a limited connection to what anyone really believes. Copan, however, takes a softer approach, and although he criticizes ""relativism,"" he avoids creating rigid categories.The content and quality of Copan's arguments is something of a mixed bag. His treatment of the subject of hell once again shows his soft approach: he denies the existence of literal physical torture in hell, suggesting instead that the eternal torment will instead be merely some sort of emotional anguish over being cut off from the presence of God. Copan also avoids explicitly claiming that all non-Christians will go to hell, though it's unclear whether that's simply an omission or if he really allows for the possibility that the Christian God will show mercy on good people who choose the wrong deity to worship.The chapter of Biblical slavery is weakly researched; Copan essentially argues that the slavery allowed by the Bible wasn't all that harsh and had protections for the slaves that were lacking in, say, the American Old South. However, an inspection of Copan's footnotes reveals that he depended for his facts on a very small number of secondary sources, mostly from evangelical Christian publishers. No doubt there is primary source material and a considerable amount of original research about Biblical slavery, and any complete assessment of the issue would need to dig into that literature to produce a balanced portrait. But Copan doesn't seem to have done the level of research that's required, opting instead to depend on a few sources that give the most favorable support to his viewpoint.On the whole, Copan's book makes interesting and easy reading if one is interested in finding learning about a softer-hearted viewpoint in Christian apologetics (though even Copan feels compelled to defend the morality of the Old Testament slaughter of the Canaanites). He does not offer a whole lot that is new or original, though, and a committed skeptic is unlikely to find any hard challenges to his beliefs.",Religion

While it was an interesting idea for a book, I found that I just couldn't connect with any of the characters or even the storyline for that matter.Patty is a twelve year old girl who lives with her parents and sister and is cared for by a nice woman named Ruth. A little bit on the wild side, Patty is definitely not her parent's favored child. In fact, it seems like they'd like her to just disappear. She tries to be helpful and kind and make them like her, but she always seems to fail.When a POW camp is established right outside her town, she gets a chance to meet some of the prisoners when they come to her father's store for hats. One in particular is kind to her and speaks to her as if she matters. His name is Anton and he is more of a scholar than soldier. Patty finds a chance to becomes friends with him when he escapes from the camp and takes to hiding in her garage at home. She brings him food and shares stories with him. Gradually she comes to appreciate him even despite their differences because he is kind to her and actually seems to care about her. However, they both know it can't last and that he needs to move on before he's caught. Its a danger to both him and Patty to be staying there.The characters in this, with the exception of Ruth, were just terrible. Patty, to me, was a brat and while I still thought her parent's were louses, I couldn't even like her. Her parents, as said before, were terrible people with no redeeming qualities. Anton was only in the book for a little bit and never really gets fleshed out as a character. The only one I liked was Ruth. She was kind with a few flaws and just seemed to be a real person. The rest were just awful with no sense of good in them. It just wasn't very realistic. Another thing I found a bit hard to understand about the characters was the affection Anton felt for Patty even before she helped him. As a twenty something year old man it just seemed odd that he would find this connection with a twelve year old Jewish girl with no other reason than that she sold him some items at the store and was polite to him.The writing was easy to read since it was a juvenile book. Since its an older book there are racial slurs in it and that could have the potential to offend some people. Most of the book is dialogue so there is not a great amount of description on the setting of the book and the characters were only minimally described. I did like the dialogue in this book; Greene does a wonderful job of expressing the characters feelings about the war and about their family life through their words.I just couldn't bring myself to like this book. I wanted to but there was nothing to draw me into the story and care about the characters. Its probably a good book to introduce war themes to children but otherwise I'm not sure what its uses are. It doesn't help my opinion that the book seemed unfinished at the end as well. I kept waiting for some explanations on why people felt the way they did about Patty and what would happen to her after she left the school. It felt incomplete.Fascinating idea for a plot but only carried out fairly well instead of the excellent book it could have been. It wasn't all terrible, as I said before I liked some of the conversations that took place in the book. It just wasn't what I expected the novel to be when I had heard about it from others.Summer of My German SoldierCopyright 1973230 pages",Juvenile Fiction

The dialogue is wooden, sometimes laughable. Coincidences and cliches abound in amateurish fashion. Spelling, grammar and syntax cry out for a competent editor.Characterizations are stiff, one dimensional, nonsensical. Among the Confederate pirates, for example, is a French Canadian who calls people, ""Mon ami,"" and even says ""Sacre bleu."" Why he is there makes no sense at all. He seems to have walked in out of a Bullwinkle cartoon.But worst of all is the shallow understanding of history, of fact, of reality. Granted, a fiction writer can take certain liberties with raw history, but the author of this novel goes off the edge. These errors go from major points to tiny details. The Lake Erie piracy of 1864, as described in this book, does not remotely resemble, for example, what actually occurred. The ""battle,"" such as it was, took place on Middle Bass Island, not South Bass. John Brown, Jr. had no escaped slaves working for him, and it was he who went to warn officials at Johnson's Island prison, not a former slave. Co. K, 130th OVI boys captured were in mufti and had not been sent to Put-in-Bay. They were on the ""Island Queen,"" bound for Toledo to be mustered out after 100 days service. The ""Island Queen,"" so important to the story, was omitted completely. Rowing a boat from Put-in-Bay to Johnson's Island would have taken many hours, not minutes as the novel implies. It took John Brown, Jr. at least 12 hours to make the journey.Among the tiny details: the CSA never issued coins; the Perry Monument at Put-in-Bay is NOT the second tallest monument in the U.S.--at least 3 others are taller; the number of guns on USS MICHIGAN is wrong. The names of the ""pirates"" are incorrect. Nitpicking? Ah, but the devil is in the details, as the lawyers say.Pehaps if one were not aware of the history and had never been to Put-in-Bay, some of this wouldn't matter.

It does seem to have been aimed at a general audience: with its large format, glossy stock, and color photos, it's something of a coffee-table book. And the fact that the editor has only included what he reckons as one-sixth of Matthew Paris' chronicle makes it of limited use to specialists. Therefore, if judged on its intentions, I have to say that it fails, for two reasons.First, as a previous commenter has noted, it's dull. It's very, very boring. There is very little here of interest to the general reader. This is due to the author's interests, as well as the nature of the genre. Matthew Paris was a monk in an abbey, and as such he was greatly concerned with ecclesiastical business; consequently, a great deal of his chronicle is devoted to ecclesiastic abuses and machinations which are very difficult to follow if you aren't a specialist. Another big drawback is that medieval authors rarely went into the kind of detail that modern readers find interesting. It can be maddening. MP will often write something like ""F. did something so outrageous that it's unfit to mention here"". I've been reading this kind of literature for years in preparation for writing a novel, so I know that MP is not unique in this. All medieval literature is pretty dull. Chronicles in particular are usually dull; imagine the result if you watched the nightly news and then wrote your own brief summaries of the day's events. That's pretty much what MP's chronicle was.Finally, I was disappointed by the illustrations. They are not related to the text, so they can't really be called illustrations. Many of them are not reproduced at adequate size, or sufficient magnification, so you can't really see their details. These often seem fuzzy, as well. It seems that many of the images that are reproduced at adequate size are generic, almost abstract representations of cities which really provide no useful information about what the particular city looked like.",Biography & Autobiography

Please note that amazon has included this review for other editions as well. That is okay because I have something to say about them too, but you should be aware. The really old editions are probably out of copyright.I would not recommend this book unless you are into the ""history of technical analysis"". The focus of the book is classical patterns of bar charts. The book is absolutely not bad, but it's value is a bit dubious. Why read a book that have charts that are 1/2 century old? You can't be sure that things haven't changed, can you? So the newer editions also have more modern charts. However, this combination of old and new makes for a frustrating reading. Actually I would think most book deteriorate in quality after their 3rd edition.If you want a classic in your bookself I would really recommend you to buy a second-hand copy of the last edition written by Edwards & Magee alone. This would be the 5th edition. It has a very professional binding and clear white pages. The new edition is a very ugly and cheaply bound hardcover. This comment is only if you are into good looking books. You get the 5th edition for $5 at amazon, so it is a nobrainer!Addition in 2010: Edwards and Magee wrote a classic that has many editions. I bought one copy around 1984 and it was the first book in technical analysis that I read. I liked it a lot. With time other books have been written, but I still like this old book. Now mainly because it is a very pretty book. Expensive paper and a proper spine that will never break. It feels nice to touch. I value nice books if their content is classic. I bought the 9th edition just out of curiosity and I am displeased by it. There is a running commentary in sections by a new third author - the original authors long dead. The commentary is ridiculous. At one point he decides to call an upside down head-and-shoulder pattern for a kilroy patterns. Hello? We don't need comments on this level. The paper and binding is ugly (but not as bad as books from Wiley Finance - please use better paper in your expensive books!). So on all accounts a ** book. If you love books, go to abebooks and try to find an old beautiful copy instead, but they are no longer $5!",Business & Economics

Back in April I looked at the initial release of this package, I found it to have several useful features and there were some updates needed.One thing need was a copy of Windows 2000 Professional and it is still not included. While the server is included the time limit of 120 days may not be enough for some and therefore this feature needs to be expanded.I like the updates to the 70-218 book as it has been improved over the last version, but the 70-210 book seems thin as compared to the previous release. I did use the 70-218 book in a class I taught in New Jersey and had fairly good results.Both the 70-215 and 216 books seem to have some updates, but for the most part they remain the same as before. Each book does map to every objective, and each book does have enough work to keep you busy so for the person trying to break into the IT industry this would be a good place to start from.For the more experience technician you might find some of the books lacking but there is still things you can learn from them. The cds included, now there are two, have the 120 license of 2000 Server. The other is practice exams and e-books; again I think that the practice exam should be increased.Overall there is still a few improvements needed, one thing the authors may want to consider is updating the books more like the Microsoft Resource kits or the Inside Out books, which a jammed packed with information that far exceed the actual exams.Finally, these four books do make a good training tool but you do need other resources to help you along the way.

In careful perspective, Philbrick takes into account all of the available records, from the erudite second mate, Owen Chase, to the 14-year-old cabin boy, Thomas Nickerson. As well, Captain John Pollard was able to relate his own accounting of the tragedy that forever changed the lives of the few remaining crew.Taking a sperm whale is fraught with danger, but none of the crew of the Essex could have anticipated the attack on the ship itself. With only seconds to spare, the men gathered what they could from the rapidly sinking vessel, navigational instruments, some fresh water, a modest amount of provisions. Deployed in three boats, the first was manned by the Captain, the second by Owen Chase, the 1st mate, and the third by Mattew Joy, the 2nd mate. The boats attempted to keep within sight of each other, but were later separated by unavoidable circumstances.Strength and provisions were unequal from the start: the Captain's boat consisted of Nantucketeers, most bonded by blood; the second boat held off-islanders and one black seaman recruited at the last minute; the third boat held the majority of the black crewmen and a 2nd mate already showing signs of ill health. Desperate to steer a course toward land, serious mistakes were made, and the days passed under an unrelenting sun, as provisions grew scarce. The men were at all times obsessed, either by unquenchable thirst or ravaging hunger. As they began to perish, all realized that the next to die would become sustenance for the living.Cannibalism was not unheard of for seafaring men, and the will to live was preordained. Philbreck makes an interesting psychological and sociologial point when he notes that the first to die and be eaten were the black crew members, already weakened by their shipboard diet, which had far less protein than that of the officers. In addition, there was a familial bonding among the Nantucketeers, survival of the &quot;fittest&quot; never in question.This is a story to be experienced by each reader, as the strengths and weaknesses of the crew reflect the eternal struggle between life and death. It is amazing that any were found alive after this horrendous experience; those who did survive found their lives irrevocably changed. Man's significance is dwarfed against the epic power of natural forces.",History

His popularity led him to compose a large body of instructional etudes and studies. As opposed to other composers of his time that also produced instructional material, Sor wrote first for musicality, second for instruction -- these pieces are therefore very approachable for the beginning guiarist, yet stand on their own musically.Because these pieces are musically interesting, several CD compilations containing the various Opuses in this book are available from online merchants; search for Fernando Sor and you are sure to find them with a bit of effort.

In some cases, I have found need to alter the recommendations but overall the annotations are well-placed and very helpful.One of the best features of this compilation is that the book is spiral bound, it lays nice and flat on a music stand without need for clips to hold the pages down -- I wish all music books were published this way, it is so much easier to work with.I've been playing from this exact book for several years and it has brought me countless hours of enjoyment.

Pity that the copy-editing was not done a little more skillfully, as there are a number of typo's and mis-used homonyms in the book the product of unskilled use of computer spell checker.Still, this is a minor quibble. (A map would have been nice too). Harry Foster's casual employment in the mines, cities, and jungles of Peru are a classic of early 20th Century travel writing. Some might feel that his characterizations of Peruvian Indians, Peruvian &quot;Anglo's, and the Irish are a bit harsh. However, he presents a well-balanced narrative of the country, and its types. This lost world (the 1920's) is a rough and tumble time, gone forever. A great loss. Foster preserves those days for posterity through his colorful writing and astute observations of people and cultures.Many modern travel writers could learn from his unselfconscious writing style. The book never misses a beat. A combination of irony and genuine love of people, regardless of differing cultures, lifts this book out of the mundane.

B000I83ZJC,The Forsythe Saga,,AJQ1S39GZBKUG,"A. T. A. Oliveira ""A. T. A. Oliveira""",8/8,5.0,1123545600,Family saga for all tastes,"The first volume of ""The Forsyte Saga"" contains three novels and two interludes between each. It chronicles the lives of the Forsyte family between more than 30 years. In his narrative, John Galsworthy deals not only with the family's fortunes but also the society of their time, and its changes.""The Man of Property"" is the first novel of the monumental Forsyte Saga and in the beginning the writer spends some time creating his environment where those Forsyte will inhabit.The first chapters turn out to be the more descriptive in the book. Not only does he introduces the most important members of the family, but he also describe their moral-social relationships -- that count much more than their blood relations.Once Galsworthy feels that his characters are established -- and it doesn't take too many pages, as a matter of fact -- he starts the narrative per se, although a slight plot has been developed from the beginning.""The Man of Property"" concerns more on old Jolyon Forsyte's life and his son and his nephew Soames and Soames' wife, Irene (one of the most unforgettable characters in the saga). Soames is the man of property, but not only has he got unanimated properties but he also considers himself the owner of Irene. She will involve herself with another man, and this love affair will affect the all Forsytes in some levels.This novel is a great beginning for Galsworthy's saga, with vivid characters, a well-built plot and charming writing. While the writer is developing the family affairs, he has the chance to portray the changes in the high society life in the early XX Century in England.In the second installment of ""The Forsyte Saga"", the writer reassumes the life of the Forsyte family. ""In Chancery"" is situated a few years after the events told in ""The Man of Property"", in a few pages recaps some of the most important facts of the first book and their aftermath. After that he is able to move on.And on he moves -- but the narrative still concerns on young Jolyon, Soames and Irene that forms a love triangle. While the remaining Jolyon become a close friend to Irene, her ex-husband --from whom she hasn't divorced in all those years -- fells jealous and considers claiming his wife back.Needless to say that this is not the only plot in the novel. Galsworthy develops more family plots. It is impossible not to have the feeling that while he is sometimes depicting the shallowness of the elite from his time, at the same time he has an indulgent look upon the rich and wealthy -- which is not a bad thing as a matter of fact.Those who like ""The Man of Property"" will certainly find more pleasure in ""In Chancery"". He finishes the book with the perfect hook what will come next.For those who liked ""The Man of Property"" ""In Chancery"", ""To Let"" is a treat. At this point we are in a transition. The old school of Forytes (Jolyon, Soames...) is about to `resign', while new folks are starting to assume the power and the money (Jolyon's third son, Soames' daughter...). The very old Forsyte school, by the way, is already history.""To Let"" is a novel of transition; it is as if the parents are passing the command to their kids -- at least in terms of narrative. That is why old plots (Irene, Somaes, Jolyon) and new ones are in the center of the narrative.The story is set some twenty years after the ending of ""In Chancery"", Soames' and Jolyon's kids are virtually adults but they don't know the plot involving their parents (the story of the first and second novel) and are ready to fall in love. It is not surprise that Fleur (Jolyon's French kid) will fall in love with Jon (Jolyon's third son also named Jolyon).But their main obstacle is not the fact that they are cousins, but the relations from the past. The narrative will focus on this Romeo and Juliet-esque couple whose union --or separation-- lies in a secret hidden in the past.Those who have reached the third installment in the saga are those who have liked it and are looking forward to see what will happen to the Forsyte. So it is no mystery that Galsworthy exploits the family changes as a shadow of the change in their society --set about the 20's of the XX Century. As Britain Empire declines, so does the power of the Forsytes that cannot avoid their hidden skeletons.",Fiction

The whaleship Essex was rammed by a massive sperm whale in the middle of the Pacific ocean, forcing the crew onto three small whale boats as their ship went down. What followed was nearly three harrowing months of dehydration, starvation, and ultimately cannabilism on the open ocean before some of the crew were miraculously rescued. Philbrick tells the tale quite well, with great realism and suspense. He also expertly provides the context of the Nantucket whaling industry in the 19th century.

Gifford,4/5,4.0,977788800,"A splended historical account, though a bit dry","In the early nineteenth century, the whaleship Essex sailed from Nantucket for the final time. The ship encountered a giant sperm whale in the middle of the ocean. The whale attacked the ship, disabling it, sending the men into the whaleships, where most of them would live, and die, for eighty-odd days. This is a rich tale of courage, starvation, cannibalism, and racial politics.Nathaniel Philbrick's account of the ill-fated Essex is thick with history. Philbrick has meticulously researched his book, evidenced by the extensive notes and bibliography. Still, In the Heart of the Sea lacks the heart of Erik Larson's excellent Isaac's Storm, in my mind the book of the year. For all of Philbrick's keen facts and thoroughness, his writing is often academic-sounding, and he does not boldly follow historical tangents as Larsen does so well.

Few sources are available, and scholarship-wise, this story is only beginning to be told. To contradict the author's statement, this is an amazing adventure story, made more astounding because its true. Philbrick also includes plenty of background to aid in comprehension by modern readers with no prior knowledge of whaling, especially the eccentricities of early 19th century Nantucket. This author seems well-qualified in this regard. This book is an informative and entertaining blend of the tragedy of the Essex, background, possible motivating factors, and subsequent developments.It is a curious footnote to history that this story was well-known during the 19th century but almost forgotten today, much like the history of the whaling industry and sea voyages in general. No embellishment nor hindsight moralizing is necessary, nor does Philbrick force any. He is a tactful author, and the facts as much as we know them are more than enough to provide a thrilling tale. This is the way that history should be written; its an absorbing read, framed in the context of historical development. It is neither too difficult for a novice, nor too elementary for the well-versed.",History

Although it very quickly went out of fashion among the modernist writers of his time, THE FORSYTE SAGA has remained a popular hit, inspiring no less than two famous BBC mini-series. And it's the real deal: I can think of few novel cycles that are as satisfying or as eminently readable, much less that are as minutely crafted.

0394779959,Summer of My German Soldier,,,,9/11,5.0,1012780800,Summer of My German Soldier,"During World War II, a group of German soldiers are transferred to Jenkinsville, Arkansas, where a 12-year-old Jewish girl, Patricia Ann (""Patty"") Bergen, lives with her younger sister Sharon, abusive parents, and her only loyal friend, Ruth Hughes, the family's black housekeeper. Patty meets her first German while helping out in her family's general store. The POWs are brought into the store for hats, and Patty dutifully--and out of curiousity--approaches the only dark-haired, English-speaking soldier in the group: Frederick Anton Reiker. He is much older than Patty (22-years-old), but he treats her like an equal. From that first meeting, Patty's opinions of Germans greatly changes, and she can't help but be captivated by him.So, when she sees him running near her house, having just escaped the prison camp, Patty insists that he stay in her family's deserted garage for as long as he needs to, which is only for a few days. I had expected Patty and Anton's relationship to last a little longer (and I'm certain Patty wished the same thing), but it only takes up about one-third of the book. The remaining two-thirds is Patty's account of her torturous life, of being beaten and then ignored by her hot-tempered father, criticized constantly by her beautiful mother, and other everyday miseries involving her narrow-minded neighbors.This book is quite depressing but realistic. I often wondered how--and if--Patty would ever survive her life, but I suppose that is the point of this story: to find hope despite the obstacles. Patty discovered that by befriending Anton, and he had enough of an impact on her to last the rest of her life.My sister recommended this book to me years ago, and I finally got around to reading it just recently. I'm not sure why I didn't start it sooner, because it was very good. I would certainly recommend it to others (age 12 and up). The only complaint I have about the book (which is quite petty, really) is the book cover. Anton's description in the book doesn't match his appearance on the front cover. He supposedly has black hair, not dirty blonde hair. Maybe it was to exaggerate the blonde-hair-blue-eyed German stereotype. Who knows.Anyway, following the book, in 1978, a TV movie was made of Summer of My German Soldier (which I haven't seen, so I can'tcomment on it) and a sequel was written, called Morning Is a Long Time Coming (which I haven't read yet either, but intend to).",Juvenile Fiction

Her writing style is such that you can't help cringing as she describes the women who act so desperate, or thinking how cool they are when they act confident.The truth is, this book isn't about ""male vs female"" psychology. It's about powerful, fundamental truths that are the same for both sexes. These truths can be summed up in a few principles:- Everyone wants to feel lucky to be with whomever they're with- No one wants a clinging vineThe way to get there is to:- Be cool, but not angry- Never try to force or controlIf you know the true meaning of the word, then ""Blessed are the meek"" says the same thing.The great thing about this book is it gives you a true feel for how unattractive, or attractive, any of us can be. If you're one who keeps making the same mistakes in relationships and ending up on the short end, read this, and you'll see yourself as your intendeds see you. You'll also see how you will be seen if you play by these rules. You may as well accept and play by these principles - you'll never beat them.Or you can save yourself the money and just ask yourself, in times of weakness, ""Does the person I yearn for act like he or she feels LUCKY to be with me?"" If the answer's ""Not so much"", you better do something fast to turn it around, or they'll be gone. The good news is you really can do something about it. You CAN act cool even if you're caving inside.A book I like even better than this one is called ""Love Tactics: How to Win the One You Want"". This book is also about these fundamental truths, with things you can do to turn a bad situation around in a hurry. It also covers more situations and is more helpful in letting you know what you can actually do in these situations where you're not getting respect. The authors' belief is that romantic desire is composed of three things:- friendship - listening, having fun, being supportive- chemistry - that physical attraction- respect - the other person knows that you're willing to walk away rather than allow anyone to treat you with disrespect.It's a great book .For me these games are over as I finally found my soul mate, the love of my life, the woman of my dreams.

I use my bread machine(s) almost daily and I recommend this book to anyone looking for the ultimate bread machine recipe book. I do agree with a previous reviewer that the 2 lb recipes are iffy and tend to out-rise the machine - I always stick with the 1.5 lb measurements and they fill my Zojirushi machine perfectly.The recipes with starters are gold. I never liked straight bread machine recipes - they always tasted off to me somehow, unfinished, raw. Using a simple poolish or biga makes all the difference in the world. It was a revelation to me. When I'm feeling fancy I bake in a dutch oven or on a cast iron pizza pan, but I'm also totally fine with baking right in the machine. My family's favorite is the Olive Oil Bread. Before I got my newest bread machine we would spend $5 a loaf for Zingerman's bread several times a week - but when I make bread or dough in the machine using this book we are just as happy and save that money. It may not look as pretty but it's delicious and has such a well-developed flavor.The only bread I didn't like was the Mexican chocolate bread - just not my thing. I am not a fan of chocolate breads in general, though. I also find the selection of ryes a bit disappointing - my family's gold standard is Zingerman's Jewish rye and there really isn't anything close in this book.Get this book if you have a bread machine - you will not regret it!",Cooking

He further argues that under the weak form of the efficient market hypothesis, ""...you cannot predict future stock prices from past stock prices.""However, there are also many stock traders who proclaim technical analysis not as a science for predicting the future but instead as a valuable tool to identify favorable trading opportunities and trends. The assumption is that all of the fundamental information and current market opinions are already reflected in the current price and when viewed in conjunction with past prices often reveals recurring price and volume patterns that provide clues to potential future price movement.In the foreign exchange markets, its use may be more widespread than fundamental analysis. While some isolated studies have indicated that technical trading rules might lead to consistent returns in the period prior to 1987, most academic work has focused on the nature of the anomalous position of the foreign exchange market.It is speculated that this anomaly is due to central bank intervention.",Business & Economics

My only pet peeve would be it doesn't have the option for 1 lb loafs and that's only because it's just me & my husband so smaller loaves get eaten faster.I'm particularly fond of the ""Country Breads and Sourdough Breads"" section which is full of recipes using different kinds of bread starters (e.g. biga, levain, pate fermentee, poolish - mixture of flour, water & yeast that you let ferment over period of 8 to 10 hours right on the kitchen counter in your bread machine). I've never heard these terms before but let me tell you, the final product is absolutely worth the extended baking time. They are ""dead-gone-to-heaven"" delicious...Another section that I find myself using a lot this summer is the ""Jam, Preserves & Chutneys"". The recipes for small batches of jams are just right for my small family and I'm more than happy with the results.

Cramer ""-Nicole""",12/14,3.0,1099267200,A Hit or Miss,"To be honest, I felt rather bored while reading, ""Paint Me Like I Am."" Being thirteen, I was quickly compelled to assume from the start that I was going to immediately relate to every poem, and every word written. From reading the description, I had been familiarized with the book as, ""True, honest, and real teens with real issues."" The only issues I found were temporary broken hearts from relationships. A lot of the material was repetitive, I found many lines copied from famous movies, or books. These poems many unfortunate grammar turn-ups, which made the compesition some what confusing and un-flattering. Juvenile would be an understatement, as most of these young inexperienced, first time poets talked of how terrible their lives were, and how the boy they liked would never like them.Some poems were good. I shouldn't lie about that. As one boy expresses his fear of his step dad, through saying the F word only about twenty times, it was at times difficult to grasp any such meaning of the writing, but his story stayed in your mind for a good while.If I am correct, ""Paint Me Like I am"" was created by Writers Corps, a corporation which is stationed in three different cities in America. Their main goal is to help children and teens find their ""creative side in writing."" These children have gone through hard-times, and tough childhoods.These kids seem to have utterly terrible life-altering stories to tell. Unfortunately though, through the failed attempts to rhyme, and the general loss of words, their poems, in my opinion, would have been better off as a bunch of short stories.-Nicole",Juvenile Nonfiction

You like to fancy yourselves ""independent thinkers,"" and like the prime exacmple below (i.e. little Ms. ""Katie""), many of you are deeply deluded mental midgets. I have read both this book and some of the choice reviews on here. There may be guys that are angry on here in their posts, but it is not becuase of your suppose independence. It is for the appalling lack of individuality you make false claim to having and the apologia for your even more appallingly short-sighted, backward ways.The ""I'm too much of a nice girl"" bathos is truly the pathetic rant of a severely underdeveloped mind. It is not any surprise why so many of you are in your mid twenties and single and having such dating and relationship difficulties. Many of you just do not get it. One review on here was right on the mark; there are many female losers out there--and you are most likely one of them. After all, only a loser would say they are not looking for a man in a review that is about how to get and keep a man--through mostly deceitful tactics that would only work on an 8 year old. Yet you are so dim witted and such ""deep independent thinkers"" that you totally failed to even recognized this most obvious fact about what is motivating you.Bottom line, is many of you, like ""Katie"" and ""Oracle"" above are very needy and emotionally insecure females (not women). Men instinctively pick up on this. Moreover, putting on a b*tch patina will not hide that fact--but rather bring even a greater attention to it for the blarring attempt to compensate for that insecurity. A man can easily piece together the unsaid narrative of a so-called ""independent woman"" like you and with ease placate you and manipulate you and then have you alone at the end to at first wonder why and then conclude it was because you were too much of a Ms. Nice type. That is your only fallback poistion.Well, love, there is a progession in evolution here with females like you. You are at stage one: the ""I'm too nice"" phase. Next comes the deepening and rapid deluding of self and a concurrent spiralling decline of self-improvement and feeling of deeper entitlement and resentment over the success of others--especially over the fact that many women are actually deserving of love and respect and have great success at love and relationships. These women only serve as constant irritant to you in being a chronic reminder of your loser ways and lack of success. Little males are not the only ones with frail, tender egos--but little females like youself can suffer even more greatly from this ailment.The thing is if you were really an independent thinker, then you would not be on here with the rest of the hundred plus like-minded idiotic clones, saying the same trite things and making use of the same fallback position responses and cliches that can only appeal to a most rudimentary, pedestrian mind, which then most pitifully concludes is possessing a unique insight and real ""understanding"" of matters.But carry on little one: You make it easier for the real men out there to spot the chaff and fodder from the genuine and worthy. You are just not the latter--and that is the painful truth you cannot bear to accept and so desperately trying to escape as your reality. For at the end, when all is said and done, it is the latter that men respect and love and the former that they despise and reject.",Family & Relationships

B000PBZH6Q,Foundation,,,,7/20,2.0,1020038400,I used to love this book.,"When I was in junior high school, Asimov's Foundation Trilogy was my favorite science fiction. Recently, I picked it back up, and have had to revise my opinion somewhat.First, in terms of character and plot development, Asimov certainly hadn't hit his stride when he wrote these books. The characters are cardboard cutouts--especially the female characters.More importantly, Asimov uses the basic idea behind the series...that Hari Seldon created his &quot;psychohistory plan&quot; and launched it, invisibly determining the future of his Foundations for centuries...as a kind of magic box from which he pulls plot developments. This drains the story of dramatic tension. One knows from the get-go that it'll all work out in the wash. (In the second half of &quot;Foundation and Empire&quot; and &quot;Second Foundation&quot;, Asimov had found a way out of this problem, by introducing a wild card in the deck.)Finally, the book hasn't aged well. The technology forseen for his far-future galactic civilization seems positively &quot;retro&quot;. Normally, this wouldn't be a problem...Orwell's 1984 is still an effective piece of fiction, even though it's 2002, and the world is far different from the world Orwell envisioned...but the Foundation books' other flaws just seem to make this worse.",Education

I wrote Grieving The Loss of A Loved One as a fellow-griever still in the journey of losing my three children through miscarriage and an infant son, being married to a man who lost both of his parents as a child and out of the pain of experiencing many other life losses.After my son died, I went to the bookstore and found (and read) many good books about grief (I list several of them in the back of my book) but I yearned for a book that would give me permission to grieve, be a companion in my journey and include a Scripture, short reading, prayer, and place to journal my thoughts and feelings. I searched but didn't find this book, so I wrote it.Although my loss may be different than yours and I may not understand exactly how you feel, I can relate to some of your pain. I encourage you, the reader,to think of my book as a personal friend with whom you can laugh, cry,vent, question and share your deepest thoughts and feelings.

John Galsworthy wormholes you into a differentworld and time, but as the essence and humanity of his characters unfold, they are extremely familiar even in todays world. What is it about a grand passion that weakens a man of formidable integrity,rigid morals and conservative politics? Irenes forced subjugation to the marital bed leaves pangs, but her beauty is a sinister seduction to all who encounter it, so one falls short of empathy with her... A booming economy, a strong parliament, living in the lap of luxury in the worlds premier city of the time.. can you say AMERICA today? And yet,are we not prisoners of our societal mores? Soames and Irene wereboth prisoners in a marriage - Irenes captivity was more obvious,but he was no less a prisoner - trapped in a passion -shared bymost men - looked at her he really could not see why she didnot return his feelings, and was terrified of losing her, because he was scared of being lonely. Montague and Winifred, Jolyon and Helen - all of them kind of in the same boat. And in the end, the man with the strongest character committed the biggest crime. Or did he? Did Jolyon and Irene not commit a larger crime when they wilfully transferred the feud down to ageneration? Soames and his daughter in the end came to terms withtheir life much better than the more &quot;likeable&quot; characters. John Galsworthy and all his books on the Forsytes read like a treatise on marriage, relationships and a life in society that we must all live in. Ostracism was terrible at the time - it could really ruin lives, and it can even today. He writes about it in its true light and heinousness.

It is a large-format (approx. 8 1/2 x 11) paperback book and is bound like most paperbacks.As with all Dover Editions, it is very easy to read and follow the music, but it was not designed as a performing score. Because of the binding (it won't lie flat) and because no attention was given to page turns, it is very difficult to play from.

After reading Jane Eyer, you will find yourself constantly wondering how she is doing. This book will follow you wherever you go, and unconcesly haunt you mind. It is an ultimate classic that everyone must read! What makes this book so great? Charolette Brontes wonderful skill, of making the characters so real, is what makes this book a classic. She describes Jane in such a way, that everyone can find a bit of themselves in her, and often can relate to her thoughts, and her feelings. Her inocence, just seems to surround her. She has such a pure love, a pure want, and yet she is so inocent, that we long to be like her. Her inteligence and pride, add to her, and make her a prominent figure in our minds. With out Charolette Bronte's wonderful depiction of Jane, this book would not be near as powerful as it is now. The romance in this novel, makes you wan to reach out and hug Jane. You wan tto tell her that everything will be all right, and with the hard life that she had suffered through, when she finds love, you want to cry for her. As the Climax of the book arrives, you find yourself reading, with a tear sliding slowly down you cheek. You feel you eyes fill up as you want to weep with her. YOu want her to know you are there. with out the romance, that touches your heart, this book could not be the same, and would not touch the heart in the same way. The simplicity of theh plot, helps to make the book a hit. If this book were not simple and plain, it would become a bore, but it is nothing more than a young girls life, as she grows, her terrible treatment from her aunt, her schooling, and her first love. This book is so simple that it is almost amazing.Clearly this book is wondeful. You will find your self reading it over and over again!

For in addition to telling the fascinating story of the FDNY's evolution from colonial times to the present, Golway relates many more -- the stories of New York City's growth and development, of technological change (both architectural and firefighting), of municipal politics, of labor disputes, of struggles by women and minorities for equal opportunity. Ultimately, it's a book about the stories of generations of firefighters and their day to day struggle, often overlooked before 9/11, to put their lives on the line in protecting the lives and property of the city's residents. Best of all, the book is beautifully written, reflecting the author's emotional attachment to his subject (he's the son of a firefighter), as well as experience as a journalist.

It's my first book in English-a translation of my second German book on Maya. The first book was written for newcomers and introduced not only the interface of Maya but also topics like the aesthetics of high-end 3D animation, the depth of logical nodes, and the basics of character animation and dynamics. It is very comprehensive and 600 pages strong. The new book has only 200 pages and was developed while I taught 3D animation using Maya 4 to students at the University of Aachen and the German Film Academy in Ludwigsburg who were all familiar with the basics of the software but not with much more. So, please don't expect from this book any instructions about how to use the Hotbox, create a Loft, or render a sequence of pictures for NTSC.My intention as an author and a teacher was to explore as much of the complexity of Maya 4 as possible using rather brief, practical, and extremely different tutorials called &quot;studies&quot;. None of these studies took the students longer than an hour to complete, but most of the studies lured them even deeper into the matter, so that eventually much more complex modelings or animations were created. After finishing all 30 studies, the students had a good overview of what's possible in the software.I also found that they kept returning to the book during other projects of their own. The reason for this constant reference seems to be the fact that the book was not written from the angle of the tools but from questions coming from real life. So, when you animate a character that has to grab a pen, you might remember Study # 8, &quot;Steering the Bike (With a Little Distraction).&quot; When you have to quickly model a complete character, you might want to take a look at Study # 10, &quot;Knobbly Man.&quot; When you have to animate an explosion, Study # 17, &quot;Erupting Volcano&quot; might help you. And if you want to mix animation phases, you might want to check the index which gives you several entries about nonlinear animation, clips, poses, and the Trax Editor. Of course, digital painting in 2D and 3D and the Paint Effects play an important role, too; just look at the studies &quot;Wild Things&quot; with hybrid plants, &quot;The Shadow of the Trees,&quot; &quot;Swim Ring with Love,&quot; or the animation of the Chinese character Ji in Study # 30.I hope you enjoy reading the book as much as I enjoyed writing and translating it!",Computers
0681994851,Jane Eyre,,A1JUYF5D6TFFHB,"Rudy Avila ""Saint Seiya""",1/4,5.0,1076716800,The Bronte Masterpiece: The Best Edition,"Written in 1847 by the woman writer Charlotte Bronte, Jane Eyre remains a classic of 19th century literature. This novel was one of the finest of its time and what made it all the more incredible was that it was written by a woman. Charlotte Bronte and her sisters, the Brontes, were British women who grew up in Yorkshire, the English countryside. To kill time when they were bored in the domestic and boarding-school ambiance, they wrote great works of literature. It's a must read for young women, but also for men and young males (preferably in the high school or college level) Jane Eyre is ultimately a literary novel and only a literary-minded intellectual can truly enjoy it for the masterpiece that it is. It ranks among the greatest works of English fiction, taking its place with the other male greats- Shakespeare and Charles Dickens. Curl up, warm up some tea or coffee, put on some mood music and read this incredibly engaging book. In this edition, we get commentary and preface by noted scholars.Jane Eyre has been scrutinized time and again. It is understood by many that the heroine Jane is Charlotte Bronte herself. It's partially autobiographical in some portions- Charlotte Bronte did grow up in lowly conditions and was in boarding school that was cold and freezing. Charlotte did love a married man who was older than her, though nothing came of it of course. Jane Eyre, a feisty, spirited young orphan, is taken away from her home where her wicked aunt and cousins mistreat her. She is taken to a boarding school for girls until she comes of age. She lands a job as a governess for the eccentric and mysterious Mr. Rochester, who is hardly ever at home and takes care of his daughter Adele, teaching her to read and write, etc. But the mystery surrounding Mr. Rochester's past becomes a present reality in Jane Eyre's own life. Furthermore, Mr. Rochester and Jane Eyre fall in love. A novel that is inspired by Gothic fiction, it is strewn with Gothic, supernatural and suspenseful atmosphere and symbolism. The tree that is struck by lightning is a warning for Jane Eyre to leave Mr. Rochester's mansion, the strange cries in the attic later turn out to be Mr. Rochester's first wife, the crazed Bertha. A fire destroys the mansion and Mr. Rochester ends up diabled and blind. Bittersweet though the ending is, Jane Eyre and the blind Mr. Rochester marry and live happily, after much water under the bridge. This novel is a long read and should take up at least a whole summer, but it's very worth reading. It's a classic. Time and again, it will appear on the list of reading material for high school and college courses. And a bit of advice- dont' just read it to pass a class, get into the story. You will score even more points.",Literary Criticism

This is not the case with Francis Connelly's ""Beyond By Reason of Childhood"". This continuation of his autobiography takes us from Mr. Connelly's boyhood in Brooklyn to his manhood.Like the original, this follow-up is filled with the colorful characters that one can only find on the streets of New York City. More precisely, the people Mr. Connelly came in contact with during his many years in the New York Police Department border incredibility. (Then again, only policemen come across the most bizarre of human beings.) As a balance to this, however, are his intimate relations with his friends, and, especially his wife and five children. Special candor is displayed by Mr. Connelly when he describes his bouts with nicotine and alcohol dependencies, and his health problems--specifically, hypoglycemia.The book also covers a wide-range of subjects: know-nothing ""connect the dots"" judges, army life, 9/11, etc. And Mr. Connelly's opinions are never disguised. His views on life are often poignant, but the way expresses them are so perfect. My favorite appears near the end of the book:""I never forget a kindness, but sometimes it takes me a long time to remember it. Come to think of it though, in a lifetime, how many do we receive, and more importantly, how many do we render?""Good question.But, as in the first book, there is a load of irony and humor throughout ""Beyond By Reason of Childhood"" to temper the seriousness. This is Mr. Connelly's unique gift: to draw out the humor from a seemingly humorless world.",Biography & Autobiography

These tunes are beautiful and many worth playing in recitals.No. 4 is a great study. The guitarist has to play in the key of C minor which has 3 flats to keep up with, plus the rhythmic challenge is superb. Again, Sor clearly knew what he was trying to accomplish with this piece. I love playing this piece myself just to keep my counting and flat-reading in condition. I don't necessarily think that this book progresses consistently from easy to more difficult pieces (imho), as some easier pieces come after some some rather difficult pieces. But nonetheless, this book is a treasure trove of delightful and very technically helpful, pieces. I teach classical guitar and will suggest this book to my students.All pieces are printed VERY clearly on quality paper, and are extremely well notated giving very good fingering suggestions. There is NO TAB so you will have to be able to read standard notation.

It is simply because 'individualims, egoism, subjectivism, etc.' are, on the contrary, what a good practitioner practises to let go. If egoism may arise by practising Buddhism, why would there imply a 'denial of a person's uniqueness'? 'Withdrawn from community' is only true for some individual monks but similarly, there are also Catholic monasteries or convents parallel to this aspect in Buddhism. Mahayana Buddhism which is the prevalent form of Buddhism certainly does not turn away from the community! It is actually a well-known fact that excelling in Buddhism academically, does not necessarily make a good Buddhist practitioner.

If no one sees their boyfriend/girlfriend/partner/lover except when it's totally convenient, we are all going to be spending a few too many nights alone.The main point of the book is that you should be your own person, and not totally dependent on a man for everything. There are probably women out there who don't already know this, but not in my acquaintance. Another really atrocious piece of advice was that you should pretend you can't cook. Sorry. I like cooking. Then you're supposed to turn around and praise and coo over the guy because he picked up a hammer to do something (even if he totally bothches the job and you could have done it much better yourself). Of course we should all express appreciation of each other (in all kinds of relationships) but I have never been able to fake admiration for incompetence, and this book isn't going to help me do that.There are bits of good advice scattered here and there throughout the book, but mostly I wanted to throw it across the room.

The book is not well organized, more than a narrative, it is a reference book but without an index. Once you have marked it up, it will become a useful reference book. I use little 3M colored tabs to do so but I think they no longer sell them.Loeb is a momentum player rather than a long term buy and hold investor or a day trader and much of his advice is pertinent to his investing style. But I found other ideas much more interesting, specially the ones about capital management. A lot of what comes out of academia and earns Nobel Prizes is appropriate for funds, mutual, hedge and others, but not necessarily for the individual investor. For example, one concept in particular that dogs funds is volatility which they equate to risk. Often an individual investor can ignore short term volatility if his investment horizon is measured in years as opposed to funds that measure performance on a quarterly basis. For funds volatility is risk. For individual investors it need not be.

Originally published as two novellas, Foundation and Empire the novel is made up of ""The General"" and ""The Mule"".In ""The General"", as the Galactic Empire crumbles, General Bel Riose launches an attack on the Foundation. Although the Foundation is theoretically stronger than the Empire, General Bel Riose has access to greater resources and personnel and so his attack does begin to threaten the Foundation. A Foundation citizen named Devers intercepts a communication that details the General's double dealings and attempts to escape to Trantor so that he can show the communication to the Emperor and hopefully stop the attack.""The Mule"" is set roughly one hundred years after ""The General"". The Empire has crumbled, Trantor has been sacked by invaders, and most of the galaxy has split into barbaric factions. Due to its extensive trading routes, the Foundation is now the major power in the galaxy. Until, that is, a new threat arises in the form of a growing army of barbarians led by a mysterious individual known as the Mule. Once it is discovered that Hari Seldon has failed to predict the existence of the Mule, Foundation citizens Toran and Bayta Darell, along with psychologist Ebling Mis and a refugee clown named Magnifico Giganticus, travel the galaxy attempting to locate the Second Foundation that had been established by Seldon.Although a much darker and more intense book, Foundation and Empire is an excellent follow up to Foundation.

They simply don't engage someone who doesn't give it to them. ~Sherry ArgovWhy Men Love Bitches is a wickedly humorous read! Sherry Argov unveils the male mind and explores the possibilities of a more irreverent attitude to life itself. What is this book really about? Respecting yourself and developing the coveted ""Je Ne Sais Quoi.""Sherry Argov's sassy wit and astute observations will be best received by women who have been too nice and are unwilling to continue on this disastrous and unfulfilling path towards overcompensating and chasing down love. You will learn:How to go from Doormat to DreamgirlWhy Men Prefer the Thrill of the ChaseHow to make the most of your Feminine and Sexual PowersThe Ways of the Mysterious FoxWhy Neediness is always NegativeThe 10 Ways men show they are In LoveThis book will generally be more useful to the single woman who wants to form a permanent bond with the man of her desire. Married women could skip the first third of this book, which mostly deals with avoiding a man's sexual advances until he has shown you the respect you deserve. Married women will find the second half of the book more useful than the first, although the entire book is well worth reading for the sheer comic pleasure.There are 10 chapters with 100 attraction principles. Sherry's Attraction Principles are also listed in the appendix for easy access.The most shocking part of this book might be page 97, where Sherry Argov explains that when a man tells you he is interested in a long-term relationship he may just want sex with no strings attached. Throughout this book you will find a number of tables with things men say and what they truly think. You may find yourself getting angry and losing respect for men in general, but take a few deep breaths. Maybe a little anger is a good thing in this case. It will show you the path to enlightenment.The only aspect this book doesn't really address is the concept of men who have a higher level of female energy. If you took some of the advice in this book and applied it to various relationships, you may end up with no relationship at all. I mean, men are human too and they are as unique as women will ever be. There are some men who want you to say you love them all the time. There are men who are in fear of the word love and will refuse to say they love you even under extreme duress.To be honest, I disagree with her about men being willing to just eat anything although those sections of the book are perhaps the most hilarious and wicked. I've yet to meet a man who did not have specific and often gourmet preferences, favorite foods and a desire for a meal seasoned with love. I've seen men fall for women who know how to cook and who go out of their way to prepare a man's favorite food.This book is very much about playing by your own rules so many of the ideas can be adapted to suit your present relationship. If you are not in a relationship, you can test out these ideas and see if your new sexy, strong attitude attracts the man of your dreams.Sherry Argov will show you all the ways to keep your best card for last. She explains why some women appear to be stalkers and why you should help a man pack his bags if he says he wants to leave. She gives excellent advice on why you should avoid communication with a man when you are extremely emotional and why your sexual desirability has everything to do with your independent attitude. This book is not encouraging you to be an angry bitchy person. Sherry Argov is encouraging women to create an irresistible force of attraction no man would ever want to resist. Definitely hide this book in a safe place. ;)After reading this book, read ""Perfectly Said"" by Brian Douthit. It will restore your faith in men and romance.

When I told my husband he likes me better when I'm bitchy his response included: ""Oh, you make me so mad.""

This book is about Booker T Washington. It's an autobiography of how he grew up as a slave and as a free man. It shows the struggles that a lot of poor slaves had when they were freed from slavery.When Booker was young he lived with his mom on one plantation, his dad lived on another. He lived with his mom, half brother, half sister and step dad. Booker really wanted an education, so he started to teach himself to read. He had an English dictionary that emphasized on the alphabet and he read it all the time. Soon the slaves were freed. Booker started going to a day school once it opened up. He was not able to go to school later on because he had to work in a coal mine with his dad. He made a deal with his dad to work on the coalmines early in the morning till nine then goes to school. When he was a little older he decided to go to a school called Hampton Institute in West Virginia. You can live there and work as well as go to school.While he lived there he had to work hard. He had to make money all the ways he could. He worked as a waitress a maid and a janitor. He met a general by the name of Armstrong. He respected this man a lot because he was very important. Booker felt honored to meet such a wealthy man, he liked the general a lot because he was very kind. General Armstrong gave Booker a personal check, which he had been saving for his own use, to help Tuskegee. That summer after his first year in the institute he had to work to pay off a sixteen-dollar debt. His mother died during the summer, he knew that he would never see her again. He graduated that year and then went to teach at the school that he attended when he was a boy. In 1878 he entered Wayland Seminary in Washington D.C. for a year of study. While he was there he made speeches in West Virginia for General Garfields presidency campaign. He graduated first class in Tuskegee in 1885.In my opinion, this is a descent book. It shows how the poor slaves grew up in a white world and how they struggled. It has a lot of information on Bookers life and how he struggled to make a good living and get a good education. I think Booker T. Washington is a well mannered, honorable man.",Biography & Autobiography

Washington entails his life story of endeavers and prosperity gained. He describes of how he raised himself up from slavery through sacrifices and struggles. With the self-reward of obtaining education he decided to develope the Tuskegee Institution to help further educate his peoples. As well he established a bond between, not only blacks and whites, but southerners and northerners (during post-civil war times).

B000PBZH6Q,Foundation,,A2XGHUCI1MYGRE,Omar Azam,9/12,4.0,1009843200,Nice book - that's it,"The Foundation saga is one of the most widely-known sci-fi series ever published. Started in the 1940's with this book, Foundation, Asimov continued the series up through the 1980's, at which point he was being basically threatened by fans to continue writing to satiate their reading interest.Foundation's setting is in the far-future, when planets have not only been discovered and colonized, but millions of planets have been organized into a Galactic Empire that spans thousands os star systems. Hyper-industry and nuclear power form the core to this civilization, which seems to have an endless grasp on the future of civilization.That is, until Hari Seldon, a scientist, discovers the science of psychohistory, by which future events can be predicted based on calculations of human behavior. He foresess the collapse of the Empire based on inevitable social, political, and economic forces. He devises a plan to save humankind from an imminent dark age by instituting a scientific Foundation at the edge of the galaxy.This premise is what drew me to the read the book. What exciting prospects! The opportunity to plumb the mind of the genous Hari Seldon. To get a closer look at this Galactic Empire, whose proportions were mindboggling. To understand, at a more nuts and bolts level, this &quot;psychohistory.&quot; To see what Hari Seldon has up his sleeve.Unfortunately, though the book provides an historical fiction that encompasses 300 years of life after Hari Seldon, and introduces leaders of his Foundation that are memorable for their nerve and intellect, some of the imaginative possibilities, such as most of those mentioned above, are not fully realized. I am not sure if they are realized in other books of the series, but I guess that's for someone else to comment on.Foundation came to me highly recommended. I am not new to science fiction, but I have not read that much of this genre. I was looking forward to something that would really blow my mind away. Though I admired several things about the book and thought it was a nice read, I am not going to read the other books in this series. Coming away from this book, I felt it was good, but not much more. There were several ways in which I clearly found the book to be lacking in addition to the brevity of focus on Hari, a good discussion of psychohistory, or much emphasis on the Galactic Empire.Though Asimov's style is surely concise and highly readable, he views plot as the central element to his writing, at the expense of other aspects of great fiction that really should have been incorporated. I will outline these at length because it appears that the book's praises are already sung widely.First, there is not much character development. Characters are presented merely to accomplish a historical event in the flow of the story. We get a feel for the characters not as real people, but as actors on the stage of world history. Though the reader admires the nerve and intellect behind each of these heroes (there are 5 heroes that are portrayed in the generation following Hari), there is little else that makes them interesting. While this kind of presentation of characters may work in movie adaptations or history textbooks, I like to view my characters as a little more than men-at-work. Everybody is always scheming, there's not much downtime or description of what day-to-day life is like with these guys so far in the future, such far-off planets. The dialogue is great, though, and that's part of the reason the book is a quick read.Secondly, there is a lack of real meaning or symbolism that defines great books. There's not much refelction on the part of the narrator, or poignancy. The closest we get to intrinsic meaning is the interesting description of the false religion that a protagonist, Salvor Hardin, invents in order to undermine the economy of a neighboring state. Religion is also used to manipulate other planets. Hard to swallow, this helps us understand what the author probably thinks about organized religion. The book is also full of cute phrases that portray the all-importance of technology in Asimov's future: characters say things like, &quot;What in the name of space?&quot; or &quot;Thank space!&quot; The all-importance of nuclear energy also seems like propaganda to get ther reader to &quot;understand&quot; how important it will be in our era, with no attention paid to other kinds of fascinating technology that may exist in the future, such as super-intellect, robotics, biotechnology, etc. Not only are technology and politics the deepest material this book touches, but even the technology the book introduces is not very interesting. With the exception of his brilliant description of the mother planet Trantor, the only thing different between this far off future and nowadays is the ability to jump through space.Thirdly, romance does not play a role in the book. There are no women in the book, which means there can be no romantic intrigue, or world events influenced by a woman. Also in the true spirit of what the word &quot;romance&quot; conveys, there is no sense of wonder and excitement that a reader surely hopes to get when they enter an author's imagination. The landscape of these far-off worlds is sparesly and hardly described. We spend much of our time in staterooms. Though, admittedly, Asimov's grasp of political personalities is astounding.On the other hand, if you like books that are centered on brilliant leaders of nation-states and how their decisions affect the course of history, you will like this book. If you are fascinated by the economic, political, and sociological macroforces that shape history, you will like this book. If you're more about the game and the moves than the players, you will like this book.",Education

So by the time the whale attacks you're kind of rooting for the whale.Then they're adrift in the boats, and they manage to make every bad decision possible. They decide to sail thousands of miles to the coast of South America because they think the natives on the nearby islands are cannibalistic savages (their biggest mistake); and they eat the meat they have instead of using it as bait to catch fish.Watching them drift into their doom, and realizing that it was partly of their own making, somehow makes the story all the more gripping, because it makes you want to somehow reach back in time and yell at them, &quot;Don't do that, you idiot!

Overall, I'm glad I read the book and am glad that I still have a copy of it on my shelves. I'd give it 3.5/5 if I could.This book has a number of blatant errors in it that caused me to question everything asserted as fact in this book. Examples of errors would be the error about the asymmetric carbon in MDMA and in the number of molecules in 2/100ths of a microgram of LSD. These are only a few of the errors, just for illustration.I also find that the book logically contradicts itself often. For example, when making a point about LSD and alcoholism, the author makes it clear that the LSD experience is not like the DTs (and thus 'curing' alcoholism according to this hypothesis didn't work). Later, however, the author asserts high success rates for alcoholism treatment with LSD.What disappoints me most about this book is that it is too obviously biased towards psychedelics drugs. When I bought the book I was really looking for something objective, but this book has almost nothing bad to say about psychedelic drugs at all. It ventures in to the absurd discourses of ""enlightenment"" and creativity enhancement under scientific pretenses.This book was a disappointment to me because in some spots it is just as misleading (though less inaccurate) than much anti-drug propaganda. If you're looking for an objective, balanced book about psychedelic drugs, this may not be the book for you. I say it ""may not"" be the book for you because despite some errors and what I see as a ""pro-psychedelic bias,"" it does still contain a lot of accurate, potentially useful and often fascinating information.The sections of the book detailing the histories of each drug are excellent. These parts were very interesting. The book does a good job of detailing the attitudes of various societies at various times towards certain drugs.Again, even though my rating hasn't increased, I'd like to point out a few of the book's strengths:It's logically laid out, with the chapters on each class of substances being well organized. It is an excellent book for anyone who is simply interested in psychedelic drugs or for someone wanting to start a personal library on psychedelics. I still pick it up and use it as a reference because it's not only well organized, but also because it contains the kind of information that people often want to know about psychedelic drugs (e.g. where does the drug come from? how does it work? how is it related, chemically, to other drugs in the same category? what are its effects?). Most of the book is full of information that would be useful to people who are interested in psychedelics.",Social Science
B0007E2ADE,"Technical analysis of stock trends,",,A3HBY2YN08FXZV,Anthony,10/10,4.0,1265587200,"Thorough, but dated and a little frustrating to read","I'd recommend this book to anyone wanting an introduction to technical analysis. It is written like a textbook with topics addressed in logical order. This book covers detailed descriptions and analysis of many traditional chart patterns and some attendant trading strategies. Numerous examples are given in annotated charts. Technical terms are defined and explained.In the ninth edition (2007), Appendix E contains a Turtle Trading System manual written by Curtis Faith (one of Richard Dennis' original Turtles) - a dated but nevertheless instructional description of a mechanical trading system.Though this book is a great educational tool, I feel it would be a mistake to take it all literally as a guide to trading. The original author, Magee, last updated the book in 1966. He goes out on a limb regularly in his advice on how certain patterns 'typically' resolve. The probabilities with which his rules apply to today's markets would undoubtedly vary from pre-1966 markets. William J. O'Neil, in his renowned How to Make Money in Stocks (2009, p.-146), said that many patterns discussed by Edwards & Magee such as triangles, coils and pennants have, in recent times, shown to be ""unreliable and risky"" patterns ""without sufficient time or price correction to become proper bases.""I found the book a frustrating slog to get through because Magee uses a very formal, wordy and repetitive writing style. In the eighth and ninth editions professor Bassetti has added numerous editor's notes and extra chapters to the original, but frequently uses awkward, incomplete sentences to belabor the obvious. More annoying were Bassetti's repeated attempts to be clever, e.g. p.- 415: ""The wild frontier of the Internet and of the gunslinger speculators. Amazon bucks on. Give us a slug of rotgut whiskey and get out the ruler"", or ""one might almost say awesome, if the word were not in such currency on `Saturday Night Live' and the `Comedy Channel'"".

It follows much the same narrative structure as the first book, Foundation, save that the book has only two `books', to the original's five, which allows for less epic scene setting, and much more character development. And don't let some of the books' critics fool you. The characterizations in these books are wonderful, deep, and complex. They simply are not done in the usual ways. They use a characterization style I term `silhouetting', wherein characters are portrayed not so much by what they do as the important things they do not do, or that which is not described in `on stage' actions. This book, though, is not merely a continuation of the first book, but an expansion of its themes, which includes some more detailed characterization.The first book set up the history of a senescent galactic Empire on the verge of tottering into oblivion and thirty thousand years of barbarism. A scientist named Hari Seldon attempts to shorten that Imperial interregnum by establishing two Foundations on either end of the galaxy, ostensibly to compile an Encyclopedia Galactica. In reality these two Foundations will be the cornerstones of the Second Empire, which Seldon's Psychohistory- a deterministic pseudoscience, predicts will cut the interregnum down to s ingle millennium. By the first book's end the first Foundation, on the planet Terminus, has survived several `Seldon Crises' via his holographic intervention, which helps the Foundation outwit its enemies, and the work of legendary leaders- Salvor Hardin and Hober Mallow, and a few centuries in to its existence seems poised to actually take on and destroy the ruined Empire.This is where Foundation And Empire starts....the book is relatively easy to get into- even if you've not read the first book. That's because Asimov's style of the pseudo historical work allows for quick recaps (in the old movie serial vein), and the fact that each chapter within each book has new characters and situations means that they can stand alone, even as they add to the overall tapestry. Asimov also makes a wise dramatic choice in The Mule section. By spending a book and a half showing Psychohistory's upside, and proving its internal `validity', the second half of Foundation And Empire shows the downside of lulling oneself into a false sense of security, as well the consequences that coyuld await the Foundation if it falls the same way the Empire did. The funereal descriptions of Trantor contrast vividly with the awesome complexity that opens the first book of the trilogy. Then, the Empire seemed impervious. Yet, Asimov is so good a writer that he rarely lapses into caricature. Even The Mule is sympathetic, when we understand his drive to prove himself. Even more interesting is that he seems no worse than the old Emperors, nor even the dynastic heirs of the current Foundation. With his powers his Second Empire might even be better than the Seldonian one. Yet, lacking an heir- due to his sterility. and his own powers, it would seem likely that even greater chaos would befall the galaxy upon his death.This begs the question that seems to be central to the trilogy: `What place does the individual have in the overall scheme of things?', or, more succinctly, `Does an individual matter?' The Mule seems to be a resounding answer of YES! He also seemingly cuts to the dubious heart of Psychohistory, which is based upon the well known Fallacy Of Uninterrupted Trends. Because of these philosophical depths, wonderfully concise and spare writing which does not bore one silly with extraneous detail, but a lean, clean narrative line, excellent characterizations, and an ability to deliver a twist ending many mystery writers would envy, Foundation And Empire ranks as a truly great novel, even outside its genre. Only readers addicted to the modern need to reveal why everything is, in excruciating detail, and to have mere action, action, action on every page, will not recognize this as not only great sci fi, but great literature. Asimov, too, deserves the label as a great writer. As The Mule might say: On to Second Foundation!",Education
087154234X,Making Ends Meet: How Single Mothers Survive Welfare and Low-Wage Work,19.2,A3CNKIV16YN14Z,Aaron Swartz,6/7,5.0,1146960000,Must read before you comment on welfare,"Bill Clinton ran for President campaigning to end ""welfare as we know it"" and Republicans cheered him on, arguing that welfare mothers (since America's only real welfare program -- Aid to Families with Dependent Children or AFDC -- goes to single mothers raising children) were simply being lazy and had to be forced to work. The TV pundits and the politicians argued about this perhaps, but nobody challenged the fundamental premises.Edin and Lein decided to do something different. Instead of squabbling about politics, they went out into the field and actually interviewed mothers on welfare. Their study was as rigorous as can be imagined -- they visited four cities, talked to dozens of mothers, and went over the books with them until all the numbers balanced out, finding exactly where they got their money and what they spent it on.What they found was shocking. Far from being lazy, mothers on welfare in fact all worked. In addition to putting in time raising their children (or getting neighborhood women to do it, since expensive daycare was out of the question), they worked serious jobs under-the-table. There simply was no other way to make ends meet. In their entire study, Edin and Lein only found one mother who didn't work any other jobs -- and the neighbors called social services on her because she looked so bad.After looking at this evidence, it's hard to think of the politicians who cut AFDC in an attempt to move welfare mothers into the workforce they already clung to for survival as anything other than heartless monsters. And their number is well-represented in the introduction by Harvard professor Christopher Jencks, who diddles away the facts in an attempt to avoid seeming partisan, and has cautiously endorsed welfare reform in other forums.Anyone who wants to be taken seriously on the topic of welfare must read this book and understand the realities of the subject they're discussing.",Social Science

Haven't you noticed in everyday life the most skillful people who have the most knowledge come from family generations who did the same business.You need to work at it to be just as skillful in any business since making profits in a stockmarket does not come easy at first.What you see is the same type of stock patterns that your Grandpa would have seen if he traded stocks. These price patterns are like road signs you should be able to visualize them on any chart regardless what time-frame. Not knowing stock patterns when they are completed is like driving through stop signs. After you have read this book you should be very skillful in drawing trend lines,channel lines, and identifying trends on any chart. Even today using a newer stock symbol you see the same old basic chart patterns occur as the old fashioned charts a century ago. No oscillators or momentum-based indicators are needed on your chart. Experience is your best teacher when you look at chart patterns and there are many more to identify that you discover on your own. In the market you must look at what is happening now then predict what is going to happen, not what has already happened to make money.

The books organization is very carefully planned and the integration of old material into new material is particularly deft for such a long text book. The section on plant physiology and form is particularly good and molecular biology is stressed throughout most chapters after an early introduction.

1562229478,Mel Bay Complete Sor Studies for Guitar,26.99,ABDG1NBSOT00L,"Donald G. Hite III ""clarinetist extraordinaire!""",2/2,5.0,1243641600,Great starting point for the ambitious student,"I purchased this book when I started to casually learn the guitar. I play the viola, so I have a basic knowledge of how string instruments work, which certainly helped me when navigating through these studies.I worked a little out of a mel bay book to learn the basic fingerings in first position and all that stuff, then i started working out of this book and found it really fun and useful.One thing I love about this book is that from the very first etude, you are playing real, beautiful music. No boring studies or ""hot cross buns"" type pieces that are frequently found in beginning books. The studies are ordered from easiest to hardest, so each piece added a little more challenge than the last. I haven't worked through the whole book yet (which would take years to master), but I've made my way through the first several pieces w/ relative ease. I was surprised that I could actually play some of these pieces so easily! I think that the way they are ordered makes it really easy to make small technical improvements. Next thing you know, you're actually playing beautiful classical guitar pieces, and it doesn't seem daunting at all!The book gives fingering numbers for the left hand, which helped w/ shifting and knowing what position to be in. The only thing that was harder for me was that there are no right hand fingering numbers (although with a little common sense and basic knowledge of right hand principles, you can do pretty well without much assistance). Luckily for me, my dad is a classical guitarist, so I had a (mostly) willing helper at my disposal.Because of the progressive sequencing of these pieces and the fact that they have a high degree of musical merit, these pieces are a real joy to learn and practice. If you've never touched a guitar before, you should start in a more basic book (Mel Bay books are good). Once you've got a basic understand of how the guitar is played, this book is a great place to explore and increase your technique and have fun in the process!",Music

0681994851,Jane Eyre,,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""",1/2,5.0,1228694400,"It is Jane Eyre, sir","It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than ""Jane Eyre"" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...""Jane Eyre"" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (""She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart""). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being ""passionate,"" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, ""Jane Eyre"" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read.",Literary Criticism

This treatment is mathematically intensive and accessible to those who have, at the very least, taken graduate level courses in quantum mechanics. The author begins with a treatment of Shannon entropy in which he shows it to be equivalent to the information to be gained. He addresses many aspects of modern physics in order to provide an understanding of the systems in which information may be imbedded, including those involving particle spin. Information in the animal and human brain is also considered; in this case in terms of the diffusion of calcium ions through neural pathways and cell membranes.The author's wide ranging interest in quantum issues appear to have its origin, at least in part, to the fact that his Ph.D. adviser at University of Edinburgh was Max Born. Though Born, he also came to know many of the other great men who laid the foundation for quantum mechanics.This 6"" x 9"" book is fairly short, requiring only 209 pages to address all of physics, with pages 210-244 at the end of the book devoted to the appendices and bibliography.

The main reason is because not only I can appreciate each singing, but also I can enjoy the connections between those seeming isolated singing by soloists and the chorus. That's due to my pastor recommended three books on Messiah. This book, written by a theology professor and Messiah singer, is both theological strong and passionately written--good for both the mind and the soul, the brain and the heart. Many parts of the book can be incorporated into sermons I believe. As the title suggests, this book is written in style of biblical and systematic theology by connecting the various of Bible passages from both Old and New Testaments. To me, it also posses a covenant theology bent-to string the whole Bible, in this case, Messiah (gospel according to Handel's oratorio) from point of God's everlasting covenant with His people. My pastor informed me that in fact covenant theology was strong in 18th century.Through this book not only I can appreciate much better what I am singing, I also admire how much Messiah's librettist and Handel know their Bible, and how much God's Word was such strong foundation in the culture of that age!",Music
0681994851,Jane Eyre,,,,7/9,5.0,948585600,Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte,"Jane Eyre is a suspensful novel that includes new excitements on every page. It is the story of a young orphan who is raised by her mean and unloving aunt who sends Jane away to Lowood boarding school at age ten. Lowood isn't the most loving place either. It is a charity school where all the students have lost at least one of their parents. This means that the conditions are far worse then other schools. These poor conditions result in a great erupion of typhoid within the school and many die at school or are sent home to die. Jane Eyre survives this however and stays at Lowood for eight years. She is a student there for six years, and a teacher for two. Then she decides that it is time to move on, and puts an ad in the paper for a job as a governess. Her ad is answered by Alice Fairfax. Alice Fairfax is the house keeper at Thornfeild and it is her job to also find a governess for the ward Adele. Thornfeild is owned by a man by the name of Edward Rochester. He offers money a job, a house, love, and everything else that money can buy to Jane, but it is still not enough for her. All through her life Jane has craved loving family and she is determined to find her relatives.After Jane learns the terrible secret of the attic she decides that she must find her way on her own. She leaves Thornfeild and travels by foot, and by carriage. She is turned into a beggar because she leaves many of her belongings in the parcel that she carlessly left on the carriage. When she is at the point of almost dying she is found on the door step of Moor house, where St. John brings her in and his sisters Mary and Diana help bring her back to good health. St. John gets her a job and a little cottage to live in. There Jane is almost as happy as she could be, but still something is missing.

Although i have to say that the plot isn't really the tightest, the righting and foreshadowing is very fine, and the play between the narrator describing herself and others.Like Jane herself says, she is not really an angel, and really is more of a woman's woman than otherwise, just by the way the plot turns out. On the one hand she defends her virtue, and her ""station"", in a reasonable sort of way, but the narrator of course is the character, and she gets a bit self-righteous and indignant at times without much good cause. The ""idea"" of love kind of turns out to be just what will make the best story. Of course a good story is hard to write, but this is why I say it has the feel of an indignant biography.Other than that I wouldn't knock this book too much. The opening 10 chapters and Helen Burns are very touching and you'll see the character, try to survive and lose all of the sweetness that a Helen Burns has over time, which is kind of sad in a way. The book is good though b/c it shows the reasons for her emotional decline from Helen's sort of pure beautiful spirituality into a real sort of adult.

We both graduated from TEDS under William Lane Craig, and we both attended Marquette University, but we did so at different times. We didn't meet until this year. I am one of the skeptics he argues against.I have honestly learned a few things in this book, and yet, I am still unconvinced by his arguments. Nonetheless, I have to say that his book offers in a concise way the results of evangelical scholarship on the questions he addresses. When I am arguing with Christians about a topic he speaks of, I take another look at what he says to see what the best interpretation of that topic is from a evangelical Christian perspective, and that's saying a lot, coming from a skeptic like me.Paul's arguments that there was animal pain and death before the Fall and that God created human beings as meat-eaters (on pages 150-152), plays into my argument against the existence of God from the horrible suffering caused by the law of predation in our world, so I refer readers of my book to his on that point.In any case, even though I disagree with him, this is a great Christian apologetics book on the issues he speaks about. And as odd as this sounds, I want to read more of what he writes so I can see what is the best that can be said for evangelical Christianity, since he represents it so well.-----------I'm the author of ""Why I Became an Atheist,"" and the edited book, ""The Christian Delusion.""",Religion
B0007EI15A,The Battle for Investment Survival,,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,mirasreviews,57/63,3.0,1131235200,Poorly Presented Advice on Short-Term Investing.,"Gerald Loeb, stockbroker and financial writer for over 40 years, first published ""The Battle for Investment Survival"" in 1935 with 14 years experience in the stock market. The book has been revised 3 times since, and this edition contains the text of the 1965 revision. Loeb is distinguished by being an investor who opposed the buy-and-hold philosophy, which wasn't popular in his day anyway, but it sets him apart from many popular investment pundits today. Most of the book's contents are intended for ""the average inexperienced investor"", although I think a novice would be hard-pressed to make sense of Loeb's advice.Loeb's investment philosophy can be summed up neatly: Base stock purchases on fundamentals, but keep your eye on price movement and sell when it goes down. Loeb was an investor with some of a trader's sensibility. He advocates holding onto a security only 6 months to a year and a half. The trouble is that ""The Battle for Investment Survival"" is poorly organized, repetitive, sometimes contradictory, and burdened by overloaded, awkward prose. Loeb is a poor writer. He makes simple concepts seem utterly labyrinthine. He has one basic philosophy and about a dozen ""dos and don'ts"" to offer. Instead of giving us a dozen straightforward chapters, ""The Battle for Investment Survival"" has 33 short, overlapping, convoluted chapters.""The Battle for Investment Survival"" is only 153 pages long. The second half of the book, chapters 34-78, is miscellaneous articles by Loeb in which he offers further investment advice, comments on a variety of financial topics, and shares his opinions on American architecture and ""How an Ice-Cream Soda Should Be Made"". These articles are more colorful, as well as more readable, than the main text of the book, though less essential. Chapter 64, ""I Don't Sell -People Buy From Me"", is an interesting account of Loeb's early days working at brokerage houses in San Francisco. In sum, I've nothing against old investment or trading books. They sometimes offer keen insight and have interesting stories to tell. There is nothing wrong with Gerald Loeb's principles. But ""The Battle for Investment Survival"" presents them poorly, and there are plenty of other books out there that do it better.",Business & Economics

L. Ray Smith's website, Bible-Truths.com, has some excellent refutations of the ""free will"" notion.He also needs to study the Greek terms, ""aion"" and ""aionion"", which do not denote ""eternity"" or ""eternal"" as is often thought when it comes to verses like Matthew 25:46. His INTERPRETATION of ""Hell"", while 10,000 times more merciful than the ""Hellfire and Damnation"" notion, is still unscriptural and a misinterpretation. ""Hell"" is actually derived from the Anglo-Saxon ""Hel"", meaning ""hole"" or ""hidden place"", hardly the kind of words that would bring up visualizations of ""torment"".Copan proves that when you are possessed by the obsession to ""win, win, win arguments against those good-for-nothing non-Christians"", you start to pour out nonsense like this. ""Apologetics"" seems to take on the characteristics of a fistfight rather than a search for the deeper and abiding knowledge and wisdom of God.

Here are presented two separate episodes in the development of the Foundation toward the establishment of the Second Galactic Empire.The first details the encounter between the growing Foundation and the still-very-powerful Empire. At the forefront is an Imperial General of outstanding ability and charisma. Unfortunately, Hari Seldon, the architect of the Foundation, predicted all this with his psychohistorical calculations. While the general is very successful in his opposition to the Foundation, his very nature ensures his downfall.The second story is quite ingenious, in that the single large failing of Seldon's psychohistory is brought to light. An individual beyond the predictive nature of psychohistory has appeared and done the impossible. While there is a type of mystery presented, Asimov either wanted the reader to know the answer before the characters, or he didn't try very hard to obscure the nature of things. But this is a crucial moment in the Foundation's development, as they seem to be vulnerable after all. This story depends heavily on a plot element present in all the Robot-Empire- and now Foundation Series: psionic abilities. Clearly this was a favorite concept for Asimov, and he never seems to abuse it; that is, it never seems there for its own sake but always represents a fundamental encounter when it appears, and you can bet there are severe ramifications.While I have noted a few complaints about the second of these two stories, this book is still very well written, with action and suspense as good as any I've read.

If you want to read a book on Mahamudra, it's hard to beat him in quality, readability, sensitivity, etc. If someone asked me to recommend a Mahamudra author, it would be him. Interestingly, he has also authored (published in 2004) a commentary on ""The Ocean of Definitive Meaning"" entitled: ""The Ocean of Ultimate Meaning"" (which I own, but have not yet read) though he previously published a commentary on it entitled ""The Ninth Karmapa's Ocean of Definitive Meaning.""

This is an incomparably astute narration of the birth and development of modern Jazz.Using the musical biographies and many scintillating details about the eleven most prominent innovators and trail-blazers of the bebop era, mostly as a prop, the author takes us on a dizzying romp back to the creation and brings us forward in time to Jazz's heyday, and beyond.Since his main concern is with the music, the biographies are necessarily thin and are almost incidental to the story: important only to the extent they shed more light on the development of the music itself. Already knowing the biographies of these musicians ""by heart,"" the author's emphasis was exactly the emphasis I was looking for.What we get as a trade-off for thin and sometimes sketchy biographies -- but with lots of juicy and often irrelevant details -- is an in-depth look at the music of modern jazz itself. In the subtext, we discover the most important thing about the music there is to discover: why it was invented, and how it was made.It seems to have emerged, almost unforced out of the complex social and spiritual ""ether"" of the post-war era: directly from the shared (scarily symbiotic) collaborative and restless minds, energy and emotions of Diz and Bird: the ""two-man vanguard"" of America's reigning avant garde of the new ""yet-to-be-named"" movement.Bebop was the form that emerged from the collective disgust with ""Jim Crow"" and the growing boredom with ""old musical forms."" The old musical forms, even those that ""swung,"" simply were no longer up to the task of handling the emotional demands, pressures and needs of the times. Something new had to emerge; something new was already in the air; Jazz had to happen.Modern Jazz thus was an organic development called up from the existential depths of angst and pathos of American black men of the times. The milieu was one in which deep musical training, vision and insight served as the backdrop, if not the launching pad for a leap into the artistic and aesthetic unknown. Without any discussions about where the journey ahead would land them, these pioneering aesthetic adventurers and explorers, were ready for the take-off when the times came calling.They came calling at Minton's in 1945 on 52nd street in New York city.Something new emerged out of the crucible of America's complex racial ether. ""Good old music"" and ""old good music"" was no longer ""good enough."" It could and would be made ""whole,"" that is to say, it could and would be made better by enriching its harmonies with substitute chords (augmented, flatted, diminished, and raised, even twisted -- that is through reharmonization) and refreshing its melodies; and by giving it new rhythms (up-tempo, syncopated, behind and before the beat, anything but ""two"" and ""four."")Make no mistakes about it, this was a heady intellectual, social and aesthetic high-wire act, and these eleven men were up to the task.

To me science fiction is about new ideas of the future and an exciting story. While the idea of a falling society, where some foresee the downfall of its society and plan to minimise the impact, is interesting, it could have been staged as well in the past. One can tell that the book has been written some while ago and it is missing the action and technologies I want to read about in a science fiction book today. For me personally the book is also very slow paced and not engaging enough to make me want to continue reading it, but rather read some chapters at a time and then I can put it down for weeks, since I am not engaged enough to read further. Still I am kind of interested in how the series continues and finally ends, but not interested enough that I have to use every free minute reading it.

Yes, I rated it only three stars, but rating this book in a one dimensional fashion doesn't do its justice, since I believe it is still a very good book, but just not what I was expecting of a science fiction and wanted to read.

0567088308,Unexpected Way: On Converting from Buddhism to Catholicism,38.19,,,28/32,5.0,1064880000,A Discernable Truth,"The intellectual rigor of many Buddhists must be comparable to that of Catholics; that is to say, there are many supposed adherents, but few with the level of knowledge and understanding necessary to any real understanding of their faith. Mr. Williams is the rare bright light in both constellations. His writings on Buddhism are highly respected and continue to be widely read within his narrow discipline.His conversion to Catholicism displays the curiosity and clarity of thought that he brought to his academic ventures in theology and Buddhism as a whole, and The Unexpected Way proceeds with a startling and defining logic. He describes the work as more of an intellectual exercise than an attempt to elucidate the core principles of Catholicism; that is, more an attempt to understand and clarify those principles for himself.In the process he has written a fascinating and, for many, useful account of what had to appear to his friends and colleagues as something of a delusion, rather than merely an unexpected path. In his work, he outlines not only the tenets of the Catholic faith, but the rationale, the intellectual basis for believing in them. He concludes, as he must have known he would, by understanding that while the practice of faith cannot proceed from pure reason or logic alone, faith and reason can be complementary or even symbiotic -- logic and reason can assist one in discerning the truth, but in the end, the truth must be what someone believes. Mr. Williams' truths are ones in which he believes, consistent with his faculties of reason, deduction, inference and consistency. He is a Catholic who walks by both faith and conviction, and his lively and witty account of his unexpected journey to this destination is an example to anyone who attempts to answer life's fundamental question: why there is something, rather than nothing.",Religion

B0007ERZKW,Burton;: A biography of Sir Richard Francis Burton,,A19Y4W9RZDRNF4,Theo Logos,7/10,5.0,1094083200,"Portrait of a Giant, warts and all","Richard Francis Burton lived a fantastic life packed full of enough exploits, adventures, and accomplishments to make any ten men famous. As such, no single biography is sufficient to capture the whole man, and anyone truly interested in exploring his amazing life will do well to read several treatments of it. That said, Byron Farwell's excellent biography of Burton is an outstanding place to begin.Farwell captures Burton's driven, restless spirit, from his wild youth wandering nomadically about Europe with his family, to his old age, when gout and heart disease finally put an end to his adventuring, leaving him to his literary explorations which continued to the day before his death. His years in the Sind soldiering for the East India Company, his mastery of twenty-nine languages, immersion into Eastern ways and culture, adventures and explorations in Arabia and Africa are all thoroughly covered without bogging down into unnecessary detail. Likewise covered are the frustrating years of unofficial exile by his government to forsaken consulate posts on the West African coast and in Brazil, years of brooding, bitterness, and dark depression. And finally, the long twilight of his life as the consulate at Trieste is explored, where failing health slowed his restless travels, but allowed him the time to complete literary treasures, such as his unmatched annotated translation of The Arabian Nights, or his original Sufi poem The Kasidah.Farwell paints Burton's life on a grand scale - capturing not only his outstanding adventures, explorations, and impressive anthropological and literary accomplishments, but his prejudices, his drinking problems and dark moods, his often difficult personality, and other flaws that were writ just as large as his positive accomplishments. Farwell's frank and honest appraisal of Burton, warts and all, go a long way toward explaining why this giant among men was continually slighted by the Government he served, and never recognize or rewarded in proportion to his outstanding service.No biography of Burton can ignore his odd marriage to Isabelle Arundell. Isabelle has often been demonize, her influence on Burton question, and her burning of his papers after his death condemned as foulest crime. Farwell, however, shows great sympathy to Isabelle. She emerges as odd, romantic, devout, and utterly devoted to a husband who was also her hero. Farwell makes it clear that she was a good match for Burton, and powerful force behind the scenes in his career.This is a first rate biography of a unique and amazing life. I recommend it highly.Theo Logos",Biography & Autobiography

B000FO7LC6,Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Artificial Intelligence),15.39,A3N7TVOTK6QHJM,Un francais en angleterre,14/14,3.0,1262390400,"Ok, but not enlightening","I own an old edition of the classic Russell and Norvig (R&N;) which I read 10 years ago and did not feel like going through the huge new 2009 edition to learn about current topics, so I went looking for something a bit more recent with a focus on knowledge representation, and came up with this book. I have to say unfortunately that while not a bad book, it does not cover much more than the old R&N; (side note on this: R&N; is very comprehensive and covers the full AI spectrum. This book seems biased toward one particular school of AI. This may or may not be bad for you: if you're not interested in the additional material in R&N;, such as neural nets, you're possibly better off with this book. I doubt there are many of you in this case though) and tends to be less pedagogical. It is also more uneven regarding the depth at which topics are covered, with a fairly strong bias toward the topics where the authors appear to be active researcher. Such a bias would be ok for a more advanced textbook, but we're talking about a fairly introductory text here, and it feels a bit unbalanced. I cannot therefore recommend it highly, but I am not highly critical either, as I still managed to learn a couple of things. Below are detailed notes, which I hope might be of interest to outline the stronger points. As a side note, this is a very theoretical book, with no direct programming application or exercises. This did not bother may, but may not be clear from the other reviews.The introduction sets the scene well and provides a useful conceptual background. How the following chapters are articulated against the principles discussed in the introduction is not always straightforwardly clear though. In that sense, the authors may fall a bit short of their overall goal.The second chapter (the language of first order logic) is unlikely to be big news for anybody schooled in undergraduate mathematics, but I understand the material must be included for the sake of completeness and autonomy. The third chapter is entitled ""expressing knowledge"" and in my view does not really do justice to the topic, as demonstrated by the matter covered in the afterthought section ""other sorts of facts"": these ""other facts"" include statistical and probabilistic facts, default and prototypical facts, intentional facts (beliefs etc...). The book deals with some of these later to be fair.At this point in the book, all that has been achieved is to show how one can use first order logic (FOL) to deal logically with some problems that a six years old can probably solve without the need for the framework. Chapter 4 shows that it is possible to teach FOL to a computer and to have him assess the truth of a statement formulated in FOL given a number of others FOL statements. The algorithm is not completely trivial but not overly complex either. Unfortunately, the time taken to deal with such tasks is potentially very large for problems not amazingly complex if one allows FOL statements of arbitrary structured. Chapter 5 is dedicated to the exploration of Horn clauses, which are basically a type of FOL statement for which algorithms are available that converge faster. This motivates the need to embed some hints on how to reason with a given problem within computer languages. Chapters 6 and 7 explore this respectively in the context of PROLOG and of the so-called ""production rules systems"". As one gets familiar with the above approaches, a number of limitations become clear and the subsequent chapters are about moving away somewhat from FOL. Chapter 8 introduces object oriented representation, using a formalism a bit on the heavy side for a concept that's actually fairly clear. Give or take a few examples, a reader of R&N; is on familiar ground up to this point in the book. The next chapters, respectively on description logics and inheritance cover material that was less familiar to me and might be a reason to dig into this book. It shows a couple of neat ideas (taxonomies, inheritance networks) and how reasoning with such data structures can be difficult when one encounters contradictions. This motivates the need to clarify the concept of ""default"", which is done in chapter 11, another good chapter in my view. Chapter 12 includes an introduction to probabilities that probably ranks with chapter 2 as something most readers don't really need. It also covers fairly superficially bayesian networks, influence diagrams and the Dempster Shafer theory. In all honesty given the brisk pace at which this is all done, I don't think it's really possible to get much out of what's covered here.The concepts in the next chapter (Explanation and Diagnostic) were newer to me. While not straigthforward to implement, it seems the core approach of the authors is here at an advantage over other more opaque techniques.The next two chapters (""Actions"" and ""Planning"") deal with topics that are closer to the preoccupation of standard AI. As they're both good topics to motivate the AI endeavour, introducing them earlier might have made more sense.The last chapter is about ""the tradeoff between expressiveness and tractability"". The authors look back at the big picture that had been evoked during the introduction, but which had to some extent taken the back seat during most of the time. Fairly uncontroversially, they point out that being able to deal with very expressive languages is desirable, but typically fraught with tractability issues. One senses that thePS: I bought the Kindle edition of the book, and as unfortunately too frequent, it suffers from some navigational issues: the table of content does not link correctly to the materials referenced (links are off by a few pages) and citations are not hyperlinked, which makes it less than user-friendly to determine what book or article stands behind the reference [137].

By use of the science of Psycho-History of which he represents the apex, Seldon atempts to establish the foundation, and reach beyond the grave to shape the forces of the future, but to what end?

He strikes a nice balance between real substance and accessibility. It's true that here and there the author might have strengthened his premises and thus his conclusions. However, by doing this he would also have moved the treatment of relativism beyond the grasp of some general readers--those who would profit most from the book. In response to the Mormon reviewer below, I have to respectfully disagree with his criticism of Copan's treatment of the Trinity. There is no possible way that Copan can be construed as veering into polytheism--or, a plurality of gods. In line with historical Christian orthodoxy, he understands that there is no contradiction in the classical doctrine of the Trinity. And, emphatically to the contrary, St. Thomas Aquinas presented one of the most lucid and logical expositions Trinitarian doctrine. To say that there are three persons in one divine substance is no contradiction. The categories of &quot;person&quot; and &quot;essence&quot; (or &quot;substance&quot;) are distinct. The doctrine of the Trinty does not say that there is one God who is three gods, nor that there are three persons who are one person. It accepts from biblical revelation that there is One God (one divine substance), and three persons or centers of consciousness. Logically, this is to say that there is one &quot;A&quot; and three &quot;B&quot;s--logically distinct, and thus coherent categories. What WOULD be irrational would be to claim that the &quot;godhead&quot; is comprised of three finite beings, with a mere unity of will but not of Being. Copan is not guilty of such a silly blunder, and it misrepresents his thought to suggest it. In short, the book will prove useful, because accessible, to a wide range of readers.",Religion
0681994851,Jane Eyre,,A3M174IC0VXOS2,Gail Cooke,3/3,5.0,1120003200,A CLASSIC REVISITED - DON'T MISS IT !,"Many are familiar with the story of the orphaned Jane Eyre. If they haven't read Charlote Bronte's story, they may have seen one of several film versions (my personal favorite being the pairing of Joan Fontaine and Orson Welles). Nonetheless, this classic Gothic tale holds such an important place in the annals of literature that if no introduction is necessary it more than merits revisiting. The audio book edition produced by Penguin Classics and read by Joanna David offers just that opportunity. It's a chance to be introduced to an unforgettable tale or to see the familiar in a new light through the estimable voice performance given by Ms. David.David, an accomplished actress, has experience in the classics - she appeared in a televised version of Pride and Prejudice and played the young Mrs. de Winter in the BBC adaptation of Rebecca. She carries listeners through Jane's resignation, incredulity, dismay, and happiness with an assured, insightful performance.Quite briefly, we meet Jane when she is living with a wealthy but unkind aunt. After being locked in a room where her uncle died, Jane is sent away to a charity boarding school. Regrettably, her lot is not improved as the school's headmaster is a cruel, selfish man who deprives the students while providing luxuries for his own family. When, at last, he is replaced, Jane days are happier and she even remains at the school to teach.Following that, she takes a position as governess at Thornfield Manor where she meets the love of her life, Mr. Rochester. When, to her amazement, he proposes, she happily accepts. Her joy is short lived as she discovers that he is already married, to a mad woman kept locked on the third floor of Thornfield Manor. Distraught and miserable, Jane runs away.After suffering all forms of deprivation, Jane is taken in by a kind family and finds work at a school. Then, almost unbelievably she comes into a small fortune left to her by an Uncle. She also receives another marriage proposal, but knows that there is only one man that she truly loves. Few will forget the sound of Mr. Rochester's voice calling to Jane over the moors.This audio edition of Jane Eyre offers an extraordinary listening experience - don't miss it!- Gail Cooke",Literary Criticism

To be honest, I feel that the author does a huge disservice to herself by using the word ""Bitch"" in her title. My first instinct was to immediately reject this book because by nature (and as my friends will attest), I'm known as my very positive, easy going, sweet, and loving individual. I try hard to be considerate of everyone around me (male or female), and quite frankly, I shy away from the negative bitch types that I come across in real life. I was also tired of all those dating books which told you what to do and what not to do in the dating world. They silently infuriated me because I didn't want to live my life against a list of actions to do and avoid.However, after receiving an effusive recommendation from a close friend of mine (who's also a very positive person), I decided to throw away my caution read this book and it has quite literally changed my outlook on life.Let me first clear up a misconception that was my own: This book does not tell women to change themselves in order to get a man. It does not tell you to be negative, house an attitude, or think that you're better than the world around you. The simple message I came away with after reading this book was that you must BELIEVE in yourself and your unique characteristics, and that in turn, will draw in the RIGHT man for you.My biggest problem in the dating world was my confidence and this book helped me recognize this. Like so many women in their early 30s, I really wanted to be in a relationship and when a guy would show me attention, the first emotion I'd feel after the initial excitement was an anxious one. My pride aside, I quite frankly saw him as my ""savior from the loneliness single world"" (since so many of my friends were getting married), and I wanted to do everything in my power to keep him.And what I'm discovering is that this attitude is exactly what will push him away!!! And trust me, it has in the past!This book has taught me to repeat to myself the following adage: ""This is me in all of my splendor...and it doesn't get any better than this"". It sounds corny yes, but I saw a mantra close to this whenever I feel nervous/anxious about being single and it builds up my own self-worth and this in turn draws guys in. Because you know what? It's not about going out there and finding a man...it's about being happy with who you are, and if a man comes along that adds to that happiness-then so be it. It's so incredible freeing because it teaches you to love yourself for all you have. That a man isn't important, and ironically--that attitude in and of itself will serve to DRAW all types of positive people to you (and quite possibly a guy you connect with.)This review is getting way too long, but that is the gist of my feelings of this book. Is this book perfect? It's not--and that's why I gave it Four stars. There's a section in there that encourages you to cater to his ego by playing the ""Dumb Fox"", and while I understand what the author is saying, she does go a bit over the top when she suggests never killing a bug or changing a light bulb for fear of emasculating your man. LOL! If it took an independent woman to attract a man, then it will take one to keep him. Show him that you don't NEED him to survive (I can change my own light if you're gone), but that you don't mind moving aside and allowing him to take the limelight now and then to massage his ego (and he does the same to us!)",Family & Relationships

Several times throughout the book I found myself in stunned disbelief that these events really took place. The book is not just the result of a strange historical occurrence, but of a people apart from all others.This book is fascinating not only because it was the first ship to attacked and sunk by whale, but because it is a tale of survival and the strength of the human spirit. Philbrick is lucky because he is able to draw upon several eye-witness accounts of survivors, unlike other recent sea-disaster books like &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot;. Through these first hand accounts, the reader can more fully grasp the suffering these men endured. Not only that, but the author's description of the whaling industry and of life on Nantucket, transports the reader into a bygone era.Surviving three months and 4,500 miles on the open ocean in small, 6-person whaleboats, the men of the Essex experienced something that very few have known, and probably no one will ever experience again. The book provides a unique insight into this ultimate trial, and any reader will find themselves gripped by the story, unable to put it down until the conclusion is known.

Since the book was published, the metal genre has expanded immensely, new sub-genres have evolved, and styles that only a few years ago were considered too extreme are now crawling closer and closer to the mainstream. And that is both good and bad, I guess.Anyhow, five years after Extreme Metal was published the world of heavy music had grown to such a great size that a sequel was needed: Extreme Metal II. This time around the number of bands has increased to almost 400, and instead of having complete discographies each entry now has one recommended album. This change is definitely to the better; because for people out searching for new bands it'll be great not having to listen through tons of records. After all, metal music is just like any other music: there are numerous bands who suck more than anything has ever sucked before.Extreme Metal II is, just like other books of its kind, not meant to be read from beginning to end in one go, even if it's perfectly fine to do just that. It's quite handy whenever one hears of a metal band one hasn't heard of before, or when a simple background check about a certain band is needed. A few errors occur here and there, but that doesn't really matter much.All in all, Extreme Metal II is a great tool for all metal lovers, and if you have a genuine interest in the music, you don't wanna miss out on the opportunity of having your own copy.",Music

B000I83ZJC,The Forsythe Saga,,AHXAPVSHPJ6OJ,A.J.,1/1,4.0,1108944000,Fine feather,"What's a nice book like this doing in a century like the twentieth? In some ways ""The Forsyte Saga"" is the last of a literary species, that which saw its pinnacle with Anthony Trollope's Victorian chronicles of the middle class and exhausted itself as George Eliot pushed the genre so far past its limits that it had nothing else to do but yield to modernism. Galsworthy, however, does not veer from the traditional style. His saga of a fictional family, intended to represent the English upper middle class (as they are repeatedly and emphatically described), is a compilation of three novels and two short interludes, the entirety completed in 1922, the narrative covering the waning Victorian era and the societal changes that occurred throughout the Edwardian era and the first World War.Thorny and extensive as the Forsyte family tree is, Galsworthy concentrates mainly on a few selected characters and one story line to guide the saga. It begins with a party showing the Forsytes ""in full plumage"" as they celebrate the engagement of June, the granddaughter of ""Old"" Jolyon Forsyte, the family's current living patriarch, to the architect Philip Bosinney, who has been hired by old Jolyon's nephew, Soames Forsyte, a solicitor, to design a new house for him and his wife Irene. The problem is that Irene is bored with her marriage to Soames and has an affair with Bosinney and then (much later) with ""Young"" Jolyon, old Jolyon's son and Soames's cousin.Irene's infidelity leads to her separation from Soames, who mostly wants a son to continue his lineage and implores her to return. Her final rejection of him enables a divorce and gives him the opportunity to marry a pretty French girl named Annette, but he never relinquishes his love for Irene, and her subsequent marriage to young Jolyon causes a rift between the two cousins, exacerbated by the fact that old Jolyon had bought the house that Soames had contracted from Bosinney. Soames and Annette have a daughter named Fleur, from whom he decides to keep his former marriage a secret, which presents a complication when Fleur accidentally meets and falls in love with Jon, the son of young Jolyon and Irene.Galsworthy rescues the story from becoming a trite soap opera by using the particular Forsyte mentality as the supporting theme. According to young Jolyon, who is not as concerned with money as most Forsytes are, a Forsyte has ""a sense of property""; that is, the Forsytes define themselves by their possessions--houses, land, commodities, wives. Soames, the exemplary Forsyte, demonstrates this by being doomed to live a lucrative but loveless life; he is not as pathetic as he is merely typical of his class. The Forsytes compete with each other and become jealous over trifles and perceived superiorities, but, fearful of scandals, they refrain from anything that could bring public disgrace upon the family name.When examined in the context of the contemporary cultural revolution, the saga assumes another dimension. There is a wonderful paragraph in which Soames and Annette witness the funeral procession of Queen Victoria in 1901 and Galsworthy summarizes the ""transmuting influence"" of the sixty-four years of her reign, from coaches to motor-cars, the rise of the upper middle class.

0801063833,That's Just Your Interpretation: Responding to Skeptics Who Challenge Your Faith,18.24,A10T0OW97SFBB,Jesse Rouse,45/55,1.0,1149984000,"Horrible answers, horrible theology","I hate to say this about a Christian apologist like Paul Copan, who has put out some very good apologetic material, but this book was horrendous. I mean it was absolutely terrible. I can't even begin to describe how many poor conclusions were reached and how many poor answers were given to problems raised with Christianity. He had EXTREMELY simplistic and EXAGGERATED explanations of what other faiths held (especially Eastern Pantheism, which he completely misrepresented).On pages 98-99 Copan discusses the problem of natural disasters. Copan&#8217;s explanations in the previous parts of this chapter seem to deal only with moral evils which result from human choices, so here he attempts to address the issue of evil which seems not to stem from human choices. He argues that natural disasters are actually necessary to keep life on this planet alive (98). For example, earthquakes are needed to recycle essential nutrients back into the continents (98). I personally do not find his argument very convincing. I think that any Christian would need to tie natural evils into the Fall as Schaffer does in Genesis in Space and Time, where he presents natural evils as stemming from a rift which developed between man and nature as a result of sin. If we do not do this, it does not make much sense for God to curse the ground as a result of Adam&#8217;s sin, for it would already have been cursed if nothing in nature changed as a result of the Fall. Further, as a philosophical objection, surely God could have created a world where natural disasters were not necessary to sustain the earth. Copan responds to this by saying that we cannot know that a world with this condition is possible (98-99), but does he really believe that there will be natural disasters on the new earth? I sincerely hope that he has better expectations than that.Copan also claims that all three members of the Trinity got together before Jesus became incarnate and decided what Jesus self-limitations should be (135). He makes it sound like God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit had this little business meeting and voted on what Jesus should have to give up in becoming human. I cannot imagine what Copan could possibly use to support this view, as we hardly have access to the logs from the Trinity&#8217;s meetings, nor do I see why this was a necessary point to be thrown in with the rest.Copan had some absolutely horrible theological implications spread all over the book. For example, he had a chapter discussing how it could be that Jesus was tempted, since the Bible says that God cannot be tempted. Copan&#8217;s idea that Jesus mistakenly thought that he could sin when he in reality could not is not a view that seems particularly attractive to me. Copan seems to be stretching things a bit too far when he claims that Jesus simply thought that he could sin, therefore the temptation was real to him (141). Copan decided beforehand that Jesus could not sin because God cannot sin (though he fails to address the problem which he opens the chapter with in saying &#8220;if God cannot sin, then it seems he is not really free or all-powerful&#8221; [138]), and is forced to reduce himself to pulling some strange stunts to make his ends meet. Unfortunately for Copan, I do not think that concluding that Jesus must have been mistaken in his beliefs is an adequate way of making his ends meet. If Jesus was mistaken about his ability to sin, why should he not be mistaken about other things as well? Copan&#8217;s solution seems to simply open up an even larger can of worms than the one he is attempting to close with his answer.Some of his answers to problems raised with Christianity are simply rediculous. For example, in the chapter discussing the Cananite genoicide, Copan says that the Israelite soldiers did not go around raping and brutalizing the Canaanites, as the Crusaders did to the Muslims (165-166). They were not fighting (in theory) out of love for bloodshed, but in obedience to God, and they fought under God&#8217;s morality even in battle (165-166). While this is helpful information, I am not sure that it really alleviates the problem addressed in this chapter: &#8220;how could a loving God command genocide?&#8221; I am not sure that a skeptic interested in the Christian faith would be comforted if we told him &#8220;well, God may have commanded genocide and killed every man, woman, and child of Canaanite blood, but He had the Israelites do it kindly and they weren&#8217;t even cruel to the Canaanites when they killed them.&#8221; It just seems to me the objection raised is that God commanded genocide, not that God had them killed cruelly. The killing of the Canaanites is the main issue, not how they died.I could go on and on. It was simply a poor book, and if one accepted all the answers and explanations that he gave, one would end up as a open theist who believes in contradictory ideas and is ill prepared to actually give an answer for his faith when challenged by a skeptic. I cannot imagine many skeptics stupid enough to accept most of the answers that Copan gives in this book. There are good answers to the questions he addresses, he just does not give them.Overall grade: D-",Religion

0862418593,"Giant Steps: Bebop and the Creators of Modern Jazz, 1945-65",,A16AIWGN7XJWPO,Paul Blair,24/24,5.0,975283200,A JAZZ REFERENCE WORK DEFINITELY WORTH OWNING,"If you have trouble differentiating among Chocolate Williams, Rubberlegs Williams and Horsecollar Williams, here's a volume to straighten you out. In profiling eleven musical thinkers who've helped to shape today's music, Kenny Mathieson enlivens his text with numerous references to other peripheral characters hovering around the scene during the 40s and 50s - for example, ""...an unshakably persistent black saxophonist from Newark known as The Demon, whom Dizzy dubbed `the first freedom player - freedom from harmony, freedom from rhythm, freedom from anything.'""Since I've always been intrigued to learn exactly where this music took shape, I was pleased to find references to a long-gone New York club called Snookie's (in which Dizzy's horn was famously bent during a birthday celebration), to the old McKinley Theater in the Bronx (where Bird sat in with the Gillespie big band) and to The Finale, a short-lived spot in LA's Little Tokyo district that Ross Russell termed ""a West Coast Minton's"". Mathieson even identifies the location of that Harlem chili parlor where Bird had his celebrated epiphany.Hey, did you know that James P. Johnson lived in Manhattan's San Juan Hill near the home where Monk grew up? That Blue Note first recorded Monk at Ike Quebec's urging? That one of Bud Powell's earliest piano heroes was Billy Kyle? That Max Roach served as house drummer at the Lighthouse in Hermosa Beach for six months during the early 50s? That Fats Navarro was Charlie Shavers' third cousin? Or that Chano Pozo's cousin was Chino Pozo? Me, either.Yet despite these fascinating digressions, Mathieson's principal focus remains the recorded output on the eleven players he's elected to spotlight: Gillespie, Parker, Navarro, Powell, Roach, Monk, Mingus, Rollins, Davis, Herbie Nichols and Coltrane. He's chosen this order deliberately - and does manage to provide substantial amounts of information on other key players throughout (for example, on Clifford Brown in the chapter on Roach and on Tadd Dameron in the section on Navarro).As Mathieson notes, no one much under seventy is likely to have heard Parker during his peak years - and no one much under fifty will have experienced Coltrane live. Consequently, the recordings left by these prime movers is the closest most of us can ever get to them. His stress, therefore, is on those recordings, with enlightening reference to the circumstances surrounding them.Mathieson says that the last roughly comparable venture he's aware of was the Jazz Masters series originally published by Macmillan in the mid-60s. His aim, he adds, was to make this volume accessible to readers with no technical knowledge of music. Still, I doubt that Giant Steps would serve as a good introduction to jazz for someone who hasn't already listened carefully to lots of it.Salted throughout are aptly chosen quotes from other jazz writers. But I found many of the author's own observations on these players, their recordings and their legacies especially thought-provoking.For example: ""As a musical process, bebop is a curious mixture of macho display and infinitely subtle musicality, of rote playing (all players have their melodic cliches, their little phrases which will always work when run over a particular given sequence of chord changes) and inspirational improvisation.""And elsewhere: ""The environment which forged bebop was a tough one, but it meant that the music evolved as a meritocracy rather than a closed shop. That element of competitive muscle-flexing probably played its part in determining both the strengths and weaknesses of the emerging form, with its emphasis on virtuoso soloing, advanced harmonic understanding and crackling tempos, and its underlying structural paucity.""Noting that unlike Miles or Mingus, whose compositions tended to evolve over the years, Mathieson observes that Monk kept the form of his tunes pretty much intact. Then he quotes Charlie Rouse stressing that Monk ""...wanted you to play the melody just the way he created it, but with the chords, he wanted you to know them, but he didn't want to hear you just play them in that way, he wanted to hear you experiment with them, not be confined by them.""Later in his chapter on Thelonious, the author observes, ""As many musicians have discovered to their cost, the kind of harmonic fudging which can carry a player through a bop structure without a precise knowledge of the underlying harmonies does not work with Monk's music, where it is not only essential to know the melody and the harmony intimately but also comprehend fully the way in which they relate to each other and to the essential rhythmic scheme which fits them.""As I read, I jotted down references to numerous recordings I've never heard but would like to (for example, a late-40s aircheck that included Navarro, Parker and Lennie Tristano, four 1949 Navarro sides pairing him with Sonny Stitt - who was, Mathieson reports, Miles' original first choice on alto for his ""Birth of the Cool"" nonet! - and a 1963 Powell session for Reprise actually supervised by Ellington) and to others that no one will likely ever get a chance to hear (e.g. an abortive 1953 studio date for Norman Granz that had Parker playing Gil Evans arrangements; Dizzy making a few gigs with the Kenton band).Mathieson envisions Giant Steps as the first in a series of similar studies. The next, he says, will be entitled Cookin': Hard Bop and Soul Jazz and focus on such figures as Art Blakey, Horace Silver, Lee Morgan, Cannonball Adderley, Booker Ervin, Elmo Hope, Tina Brooks and Gigi Gryce.Except for a puzzling reference to ""Senator Adam Powell"" and an assertion that Miles' ""Budo"" is a contrafact of Bud Powell's ""Hallucinations"" (wait, aren't they the same tune, as the author himself indicates elsewhere?), I have no quibbles concerning factual statements, artistic judgment or style.I hope that the next edition of Giant Steps boasts a far more attractive cover plus an index (crucial for those who'll use this book as a reference). And since readers will doubtless want to know something about Kenny Mathieson himself, how about a bio page?",Music

D'Anconia ""shonstar@hotmail.com""",5/5,5.0,1072396800,A Rational Science Fiction Saga,"Recently, I picked up a copy of the first book in Issac Asimov's Foundation series, for which this review is written. I will not spoil the book in this review as some others have done.The theme was quite interesting. Essentially, one man somewhat manipulates humanity into protecting its knowledge and creative abilities by setting them apart from the &quot;masses&quot;, so that they can weather the coming dark ages. The great joke of this book is that Asimov almost makes it seem as if history is pushed forward by the &quot;masses&quot; themselves but in reality, his apparent humanism and rationality comes through as he shows that it is always the &quot;individual&quot; who in the end can save or destroy humanity.If you are a man (or woman) who cares about how ideas move history, if you believe in the sanctity of the individual, if you love life, then this is a book for you.Asimov is a man of reason and he shows it well throughout this first, in what I hope to be an excellent sci-fi series. Often times, contemporary authors infuse their lack of values into their books and characters, making one wonder who one should be rooting for. Asimov paints a clear picture of the values within man that make him worthy of praise (or not) - reason, justice and a love of life.This book can proudly stand side by side with Ayn Rand's Anthem and Orwell's 1984 as a warning to society about the dangers of the &quot;irrational&quot; in all its glorious forms.",Education

B000PBZH6Q,Foundation,,AG7R3MMF8QLDT,TW,2/2,4.0,1341273600,A Well Deserved Science Fiction Classic,"Isaac Asimov is one of the few popular science fiction writers whose fame is derived mostly from his intriguing story line and character interactions as oppose to pure imaginative science. In fact, given that this series takes place 50,000 years into the future, one could easily argue that its incredibly short sighted given how little science has evolved; yet this detracts very little from just how entertaining this book and the series is. Asimov is a fantastic writer in terms of creating intrigue, wit, and believable dialog, and the result is he has developed a very enjoyable series.Foundation is the first book of the original three that Asimov wrote in the Foundations series, and although the series is now quite a collection of books with some even taking place before the period of this book, Foundation still represents a terrific point to enter the series. The premise is that a science exists that is able to predict the downfall of an empire that ruled the galaxy for 20,000 years, and as a result a foundation (two in fact) is set up to ultimately shorten the period of anarchy that will result in the empire's downfall. This of course leaves open plenty of intriguing possibilities and Asimov does not disappoint.Asimov is very straight forward in his writing and leaves little open to interpretation. He has often been criticized for this style, yet in place of open ended complexities the book contains a quality that fully immerses its readers and satisfies them with clear and definitive answers. Reading the foundation novels is somewhat akin reading a history book that that highlights specific elements of importance. This style may not appeal to everyone, but once you are engrossed in the story line you will find it hard to put this book down (as well as many others in the series).***For those new to the series, here are the specific seven books tied directly into the Foundation story line and their original date of publication. I read these in the order they were published and was very happy to have chosen that order. Asimov also tied in some of this other book series into this one (specifically his Robot series) thus making the entire story line a much larger volume of books.Prelude to Foundation (1988)Forward the Foundation (1993)Foundation (1951)Foundation and Empire (1952)Second Foundation (1953)Foundation's Edge (1982)Foundation and Earth (1986)",Education

The only fault I find with this 1st book is that the 3 main characters are exactly the same person. Seldon, Salvor Hardin and Hober Mallow are the exact same character. All calm, cool and collected. Perfectly confident and perfectly logical. No difference in dialogue and problem solving skills, you wouldn't be able to tell from Asimov's writing that these characters are from different time periods and are from different cultures. For that matter, every character in the book seems to be of the same culture and dialect. I realize Asimov uses a minimalist style of writing, like Hemmingway, there are good and bad sides to this. No fleshing out of characters has to be considered weakness in Asimov's writing. It may have made for a longer book, but his characters would have been better served if they all didn't behave as robots.",Education
1928746039,The Cannibal's Wife: A Memoir,,A2BRK7BHAZ3WIM,Isa,7/8,5.0,983232000,Patterns of abuse,"For me, this book showed clearly that it is children who are abused (sexually or emotionally) who are most vulnerable, as adults, to suffer similar abuse again--and remain silent. Unfortunately, I know many similar stories of sexual abuse by clergy and counselors who abused power over while pretending to serve those in their care. An example is a psychiatrist in a West European country, running an isolated clinic for women with psychosomatic problems, and &quot;helping&quot; his patients by forcing them into sex!The most horrible part is that, in all the cases I know, the victims of abuse called for help many, many times before anyone even believed their stories. It is the failure to find even a single suitably &quot;enlightened witness&quot; (in the words of Swiss psychiatrist Alice Miller) that in the end shocks me more than the instance of abuse. (Don't we all suspect that an abuser like Fr. Frank was himself victimized as a child?)It seemed to me that Fr. Frank's supervisor was also an abuser: he was hardly likely to have reported Fr. Frank. And also Fr. Stamp, before representing Sister Yvonne, had perpetrated sexual abuses on children... The web of abuse is very vast; many people in the clergy have a stake in keeping victims silenced.Sister Yvonne was deeply troubled that so few people believed and supported her when she finally told the story that had caused her to lose spirituality and optimism. I believe her; I know that her story needs retelling many times before healing can occur. It is for us to listen, again and again, even when the listening hurts us or the story seems old. This is the least we can do to break the pattern of abuse.For anyone with a similar history, I can recommend the books of Anne Wilson Schaef and those of Alice Miller (in translation from the Swiss German). For the Catholic Church, I wonder when it will notice the harm done in its treatment of women and children...",Biography & Autobiography

0681994851,Jane Eyre,,AIKSUSO0OE656,Fady Gharbawy,1/2,4.0,1200960000,Great Content. A Bit Too Lengthy.,"Charlotte Bronte discusses one the most important issues we face today in our society--namely a girl's struggle to be loved but also to be socially and mentally independent. Jane Eyre is a lonely, miserable child, who finally becomes a happy, satisfied wife. She does so only after struggling and suffering as a child and later as a young woman. Although the content is very interesting for most, I believe that Bronte could have fitted it in 280 instead of 480 pages.Jane initially maintains her romantic relationships superficial since, according to her, they will result in her lack of independence. Jane's romances with Rochester and St. John are not essentially based on true love, and thus, do not flourish. Rochester is interested in Jane because of her intelligence and piano skills; however, Jane believes that the great social differences between her and Rochester make her unworthy of this relation. A marriage would mean abiding by a husband's orders and the household's chores, which definitely is not her connotation of love. Jane's undeveloped romantic relationships fortify her desire for independence and romance simultaneously.Only by becoming socially and economically equal to Rochester does Jane finally seek a deep, lasting romantic relationship, fulfilling Bronte's assertion that a rational balance between emotions and desires is required to become happy. Jane's acquaintance with her cousins provides her the emotional support she seeks throughout the novel. An added support is Jane's inheritance of her wealthy uncle, which makes her not only socially but also economically equal to Rochester. Now that Jane is economically, socially, and emotionally autonomous, she can accept Rochester's proposal.In Jane Eyre, Jane discovers the secret of having a happy life through rationally balancing her desires for independence and her emotions towards Rochester and St. John. Nowadays, many young women struggle to achieve this balance. Therefore, I greatly encourage any who face that same problem to read this book. Maybe you will find your solution in one of the pages.",Literary Criticism

This book gives many techniques that can only be done in a gym, on many different machines. If you enjoy training at home, on you own equipment, you will find that many of the exercises cannot be done without specific machines. The author shows a photo of a woman doing the exercise and then gives a VERY BRIEF description of what she is doing. He never addresses proper form of the exercises or what to be sure not to do in order to achieve maximum results and prevent injury. This book also seems to be focused towards women body builders or health competitors. Aproximately every chapter has a short story on a female weight trainer and they are all competitors. This told me alot about the author's goal of the book, because he seems to think that &quot;perfect&quot; is more bulky than I think the average woman pictures herself. In the cardio chapter the author tends to take off with his vast knowlege of training, and begins to lose the reader with his terms and points that he is trying to make, without giving you some background to what he is talking about. He also is ever sure to point out all of women's short comings and why she will never be able to train at the same level as a man wether it be weights, or cardio exercise (as if that was our goal). Bottom line, this book is aimed at satisfying the more Golds Gym, die-hard iron pumping, G-I Jane type, not a woman who wants to have a sleeker, sexier, but very feminine physique.",Sports & Recreation

Resort to cannabilizm to survive.,"What a powerful book. This book drew lots of emotion out of me and I developed lots of empathy for the whalers and their families, plus the slaughtering of the whales added to my wanting of the whaling industry of today totally stopped. Its totally inhumane, gross and horrible. I feel for the whales too.Great action and historical truth about the whale ship Essex and her crew and their families in Nantucket.In the Heart of the Sea The Tragedy of the whaleship Essex is a page burner. Read it in 1 1/2 day. No boring parts...a fascinating read.This was the true story Herman Melville based his epic great novel Moby Dick on.Nathaniel Philbrick wrote a fascinating true historical book on the tragedy that befalls the crew on the whale ship Essex. 1819 the whale ship Essex and her 20 man crew leave Nantucket island for a 1 1/2 year regular whaling voyage. Unfortunately the Essex is rammed twice by an estimated 85ft Sperm Whale. The Essex is capsized and later sinks. The crew abandon ship in 3 small whaleboats with only a few hundred pounds of hardtack for food and luckily several nautical sighting instruments.LOTs of mistakes are made by Captain George Pollard, first mate Chase and a man named Joy in charge of their respective whaleboats. The captain had originally the right idea to head for an island but was swayed by the other officers because of fears of cannibals on islands to head for South America. We see the tragic dilemma of missing the right winds, missing closer islands with no cannibals and having to travel thousands of miles and running out of food and water. The men are forced to become cannibals and eating their dead friends and one time a young man ( Captain Pollard's nephew) draws a lot and is killed and eaten. Strange and suspect that the first eaten were all the black sailors. INMO the true Nantucket natives kept to themselves and became the hawks to prey on the blacks who seemed to get sicker first. The blacks had the poorer food on the Essex and developed less body fat to sustain them in their hunger and lack of food shipwrecked at sea.This to me was a very emotional tragedy story not a true adventure story. If you can't feel for these people you have no emotions.Two partial boats with a few survivors are rescued after a few months at sea...most dead and eaten by the survivors. One boat found with only 4 skeletons. Three men are left on a small island with only their wits to capture the little food on the island and a spring that goes out under the tide so little or no water, are later rescued.You can imagine what the different families on Nantucket went through after hearing about the Essex sinking and later the survival stories related to cannibalism. Gives me the horrors just thinking about it.Just look at all the 5 star reviews. Lots of other reviewers thought this was a great book. If you want a book that will pull on your emotions and let you develop deep empathy toward the whalers and their families this is the book for you. Again INMO this is not a true adventure book but a deeply emotional tragedy. Also lots of great nautical whaling history before and after the Essex tragedy. 5 stars",History

Turing,-- strings of bits, i.e., 0s and 1s; a mathematical model, now called the Turing mashine. Why not two-level quantum systems? The thought was long in coming: From Bohr and Heisenberg to Feynman! The bright idea finally arrived, and with vengeance. An model for computation based on two-level quantum systems was suggested in the 1980ties by R.P. Feynman and D. Deutsch. Then another wait: It wasn't until Peter Shor's qubit-factoring algorithm in the mid 1990ties that the subject really took off, and really caught the attention of the math community. The 'unbreakable' codes might be breakable afterall! The fact that Shor founda polynomial factoring algorithm naturally shook up the encryption community as well; and for obvious reasons. New elements of thinking in the quantum realm, and not partof the classical frame of mind, include the basics of quantum theory: superposition of (quantum) states, uncertainty, and(quantum) coherence. Although these concepts are at the foundation of quantum theory, they make a drastic change in the whole theoretical framework for computation: Now when one passes from the classical notion of bit-registers tothat of qubit-registers, the laws of quantum mechanics take over; and exclude the traditional cloning principle of error correction. Something different must take its place: A new theory! Mathematical physicist and computer scientists must revisit Bohr, Einstein, Heisenberg, Pauli, and Dirac. In passing from logic gates to quantum gates(unitary matrices), theconcept of switching-networks from computer science changes drastically. It introduces new challenges, and new truely exciting opportunities. It is not easy for authors who break with tradition to make everyone happy;-- this is especially so in a new field,--one which has grabbed headlines, and one whichis at the same time interdisiplinary. -- This intriguing book covers several of the appropriate areas of physics (quantum theory, (some) experiment...), of artificial intelligence, of philosophy, of computer science (the mathematical physics side of the subject), and of math (operators in Hilbert space, and the theory of algorithms). In my opinion, the author did a great job. The level of the book is suitable for grad students in math, in CS, and in physics: It could perhaps have used some more worked examples and exercises. (Fortunately they can be found in other books on quantum computation, such as the Nielsen-Chuang book.) This book is timeless,-- and I expect it will also be popular ten years from now.",Science

0394779959,Summer of My German Soldier,,,,8/12,5.0,995846400,A Kid's book Adults Can Appreciate,"I love this book for many reasons. First, because it is so politically incorrect, in its depiction of the unlikely alliance between a misfit Jewish girl and a rather naive German prisoner of war in the small minded setting of WWII era American rural south.This book was published in 1973, and written by a Jewish woman who was the same age as the protogonist, Patty Bergen, during WW II and who likewise grew up in a rural Arkansas town. My guess is that it wouldn't even be published today -- the very idea of giving a German the benefit of the doubt is now taboo, in the aftermath of Daniel Goldhagen and his book, Hitler's Willing Executioners, in which he has supposedly proved, once and for all, that all Germans are evil, and equally responsible for the Holocost.Yes, it is shocking that Patty felt so abused by her Jewish parents that she sided with a German. Unfortunately, that's how people sometimes behave in real life. That's why this book transcends the genre of young adult novels -- all the major characters are deeply flawed, from Patty, who should know better than to committ treason, to Anton, who should have sat tight, seeing as he was being treated just fine by the Yanks, to her self-centered and I'm afraid all too typical parents. We see that being a member of a beleagured minority group (Jews) doesn't make Patty's parents saints. They are as class conscious as any of their redneck neighbors.This book, if published today, would probably be attacked for being antisemitic, simply because some of the Jewish characters aren't perfect. (Her grandparents, by the way, provide a contrast of warmth and fairness.)This book provides no panaceas at the end, when the heroine is still far from in the clear. It is a morally challenging book that surprised me at every turn with its realism and fearlessness.In a way I have more respect for it than I do for To Kill A Mockingbird, which other reviewers here compared it to. That book itself has become a predictable cliche, much imitated, of moral right and wrong -- of course white people are always wrong, and black prisoners innocent victims. Greene's book, on the other hand complicates the simplistic liberal equation.A breath of fresh air in an era of PC censorship.",Juvenile Fiction

0681994851,Jane Eyre,,,,3/3,5.0,1138060800,The Story of Jane Eyre,Every middle to high school student should read Jane Eyre because it is easy to relate to. It tells the story of a young girl who is mistreated as a child.She wants to go to school so her Aunt sends her to a boarding school. The boarding school develops a serious disease that takes on an important role in her life. I enjoyed it because it is a book where you just can't put it down. It was really interesting. I was able to understand it because of the extrordinary details that Charlotte Bronte included in the story.The story of Jane Eyre is about adapting to new places and conflict between characters. The story starts when Jane is living at her Aunts house because her Uncle died. Then she goes to school. Her Aunt only cares about her three children. The only person Jane likes at her Aunts house is the maid. When Jane grows up she moves to a lot of places.The characters in this book are very different than many people. When Jane is young her Aunt mentally abuses her. That is because she has to live with her Aunt. When her Uncle died she felt betrayed so now she wants revenge. She wants to go to school so her Aunt sends her to an awful boarding school.The setting takes place in many different areas. The main place that the story of Jane Eyre takes place in is England. I think that is cool because I live in the U.S. I also think it is cool because I don't know that much about England. In the story it seems like Jane just can't settle down in one place.Overall I thought that this book was interesting because it is based on a true story. It was easy to get a good picture because of the great details. It is easy for middle school students to read Jane Eyre because many don't realize that someone's life can be so horrible and change into a life that everyone wants.I recommend that you read this book because it is a book about overcoming challenges.,Literary Criticism

I was disturbed by the two sentence synopsis on the list and decided to purchase and read it myself to find out if the school to which I pay a princely sum every year, was indeed recommending a book with such a poor moral foundation. What I found out was that not only was the two-sentence synoposis accurate, the book was worse than described. (To get a plot summary look at some of the other reviews--I won't waste space with that here.)Nowhere in this book is there an acknowledgment that POWs--regardless of what their personal political stands may be--belong in POW camps until the end of hostilities. The heroine of this story is in fact championed for protecting an escaping POW. There had been no build up suggesting that conditions at the camp were subhuman, etc. No, he just didn't want to be there. He wasn't a Nazi, he was misunderstood, a product of his historical circumstance, etc.Our heroine's eventual punishment is presented as the result of an unfortunate legally-required minimum, not as an appropriate punishment for her actions. She is now the victim of a legal system that can't acknowledge her personal circumstances--her evil father and mother who through their lack of love drove her to want to help the German soldier.The fact is, our heroine's ""protection"" of the soldier is an indirect cause of his eventual death, something which never even seems to occur to the heroine--or to anyone else for that matter. It is odd that after portraying the soldier as having such great personal potential and goodness that he should be protected from internment at a POW camp, the author does nothing to suggest at his death that his life had any value beyond his relationship with our heroine. Even there his memory serves as nothing more than a foundation for her daydreams. And her daydreaming is not about his life cut short, it's about her playing the role of sympathetic visitor to his grieving mother in Germany!Not only does this story present extremely poor choices by a 12-year-old as praiseworthy, it never questions a relationship between a 12-year-old girl and a 19-year-old man, and it romanticizes death--a very unfortunate theme among much of what passes for award-worthy modern children's literature.Finally, all of the characters are completely one-dimensional. The heroine's parents are evil without explanation, the German soldier is a perfect gentleman, the townspeople are hysterical bigots, the heroine's black maid is wise and the only source of love for the heroine.With all the great literature out there, why do we have our children read this junk? What our children read is important and it is very disturbing that it appears from the other reviews that a great many schools seem to be using this book as part of a literature or history program. It is poor on all levels, poorly written, poor character and plot development, and poor moral lessons.",Juvenile Fiction

Jones,7/7,4.0,1145145600,Pure pleasure,"Gary Giddins was only a name to me until Ken Burns's JAZZ series aired on PBS in early 2001. While I appreciated all the commentators in that remarkable series, it was the observations of Giddins that I began to eagerly anticipate night after night. He made me SEE music that I knew and loved but whose structure and complexity I had often been unable to grasp. Despite some jazz appreciation classes in college and haphazard collecting of old jazz records over the years, I had not gotten much past the ""I know what I like"" phase. His passion for music I was less familiar with led me on some rewarding treasure hunts.I bought ""Visions of Jazz"" shortly after the conclusion of the Burns miniseries. I devoured it. I have turned to it time and again in the intervening years. Many critics overanalyze their subjects to the point where they suck the life out of the very thing they're attempting to illuminate. Giddins does not have that problem. His prose sings and swings with the elan of his beloved Sarah Vaughan.Giddins's re-examination of the music of Ellington and Armstrong may seem at first blush to be superfluous; you may think you know all there is to know on that subject. But he proves that even the most accessible jazz figures and their music evolve from and operate within a such a complex idiom that periodic re-evaluation is necessary, and, if approached with respect for both the subject and the reader -- which Giddins has above all else -- it is most welcome indeed.There are chapters in ""Visions of Jazz"" about musicians with whom I was completely unfamiliar. But I took a chance and read them, and wound up buying some Matthew Shipp recordings. It's that kind of book. You can take out as much as you put in.As much as I appreciate Giddins's bone-deep love of jazz, his scholarship and wry humor, I also respect him for his fearlessness in making a case for, say, the inscrutable Cecil Taylor. But I am probably a big fan of someone who leaves Gary Giddins cold, and that's OK. The jazz tent is big enough for us all.Why not 5 stars? The only ""perfect"" thing in jazz is Ellington's ""Just a-Sittin' and a-Rockin.""",Music

B000I83ZJC,The Forsythe Saga,,A3MH7HTSGWRCJ0,trainreader,3/3,4.0,1224892800,Detailed depiction of an early Twentieth century upper class British family,"As stated in other reviews, ""The Forsyte Saga"" actually consists of three books and two short stories (or ""interludes"" since they are placed in between the novels). Written over a span of more than 20 years, it makes for a rather lengthy work (850 pages). I was indeed grateful for the inclusion of a family tree, because there are numerous Forstyes and their spouses to keep track of. Galsworthy writes in a highly detailed manner such as when describing a character's furniture or garden. In fact, if I could make one criticism, at times, I think each of these books dragged because Galsworthy became too bogged down on some meticulous description of plant life or the like. Sometimes the reader just wants the action (Anthony Trollope, I think, had a better sense of proportion regarding driving plot as opposed to describing surroundings).Nevertheless, I would still call ""The Forsyte Saga"" classic British literature because of the author's prodigious skill in creating characters together with the details that surround their lives. Obviously, Galsworthy had some central themes on his mind, especially the never ending struggle between wealth and property verses art and beauty. Or, if you will, realism verses idealism. Galsworthy is no naif though: he understands that without benefactors art can't survive. He also has some rather strong views about art itself - for instance, he mocks much of modern art (through the ""lame ducks"" of June). But the representatives of the central struggle are Irene/Joylon/Jon vs. Soames/James/Fleur. With Soames, we have, perhaps, one of the most memorable characters in all of English literature.I found some of the characters a bit unrealistic and dry (to compare with Trollope again, the latter had a much better sense of humour). As far as specific plot complaints, I can almost guarantee that a person like Irene would not be happy with Jolyon, nor make such a good loving mother. The relationship between Irene and her son Jon was a bit too Freudian for my tastes. Plus, in the most dramatic section of the saga, the final novel, I kind of thought that Jon, someone whom I think the author wants us to admire, becomes the quitessential milksop. But, overall, if you, like me, enjoy 19th and early 20th century English Literature, I highly recommend ""The Forsyte Saga.""",Fiction

I have to admit that although I don't read a lot of science fiction, I know priority is never put on characterization. However, since nearly all of the ideas of the book are no longer relevant, this shortcoming becomes glaring. The book is more of a time capsule than a living book.There is actually a single main character who re-occurs as 3 different personas (Seldon, Hardin, and Mallow). SeldonHardenMallow is calm, calculating, and always right. His opponents flail around until the denouement when SeldumHardenMallow has maneuvered them into exactly the right position and emerges victorious. It's so predictable that there isn't any dramatic tension.The biggest problem I had with the book is that the politics seem very nave. This novel was supposedly based on Gibbon's ""The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,"" but Foundation seems to have only to most primitive understanding of that work.I don't really understand the love generated toward this book.

Spanning some several thousand years, and multiple generations of characters (often more than one per book), the author does a fantastic job keeping each set unique and captivating. The stories follow the progression of Psychohistory, a technique for predicting the future behavior of masses of people, and the people set up to use its information to further the birth of a greater galactic empire. Space battles, intrigue, mutants, telepathy and mind control, as well as personal triumphs and failures run throughout all the novels. They are, in my opinion, among the best crafted series in the sci-fi genre ever produced.",Education

However, I have another book by Hensperger (which I like very much also) and I was interested to see her recipes tailored to the machine. Her recipes are innovative and they work beautifully. Her olive bread, for example, uses about twice the olives of other recipes I've tried, and I was afraid the salt content would prevent this one from rising - on the contrary, I produced a large loaf with a rich brown color and hearty olive flavor. Other recipes in the book have been similarly pleasing. The book also contains sidebars with valuable information about bread making topics, and includes an appendix with sources for materials and supplies, etc. This is a great book for someone who's just buying their first bread machine, and also for those of us who've become a bit jaded by the standard bread machine recipes found in other books.

None of the topics are covered in much depth, but they are identified and discussed adquately. Just about all the topics covered are what a nonprofit Executive Director really should become expert in BEFORE she tries to found and run a nonprofit of her own. Unfortunately far too many nonprofit leaders try to become Executive Directors, Development Directors, or the like before they are ready. They probably haven't read this book when they should have.This book is split into 5 sections:I. Understanding nonprofit agencies (1-2)II. Guiding a nonprofit to success (3-6)III. Fundraising 101 (7-13)IV. Marketing, public relations, and the Internet (14-17)V. Appendices (18-21)And the five sections are split into 21 chapters:1. What is a nonprofit agency?2. Crafting a mission statement3. Building a nonprofit team4. Working with a board of directors5. Improving your day-to-day management skills6. Paperwork: corporate bylaws and financial statements7.

After you read the cursory explanations for each, then I highly recommend you do some Google searching on the terms in order to find more in depth coverage. Treat this book like an outline for a research project on how to run a nonprofit and you will be really happy you got this book.I think the book would have been better if it had a chapter on Capital Campaigns and the feasibility studies necessary to have a good capital campaign. And I would have liked to see a chapter on major gift fundraising. And the book would have been more special if it had a resource chapter that listed great books on nonprofit management and fundraising. But none was included.I would have liked the book better if the section on fundraising had been organized a little differently. I think of fundraising as being about (1) annual campaigns, (2) grants, (3) special events, (4) major gift programs, (5) endowment campaigns, and (6) capital campaigns. Direct mail, advertising, public relations and the Internet all relate to annual campaigns. Those chapters probably should have been consolidated. Obtaining corporate donations and grants are close cousins. They probably should have been consolidated in a chapter entitled ""grants.""

This is author Jay Hatheway's story of the nation's first gay Green Beret court martial. Compelling. It happens to be a first person account, as defendent Hatheway, who survived those dark days, remembers the events surrounding the tragic injustice. Transcripts from the actual trial add immediacy to the ""you are there"" narration.There is an inclination to think of Jack Nicholson's despicable character in A Few Good Men, but Guilty As Charged is especially vile in that it lays bare the military's bent for public degradation and humiliation of a gay man -- by innuendo and inference. Hatheway's chiling story just quite possibly could have been our own. The telling is painfully detailed.Hatheway never denies to the reader that he has engaged in homosexual activities; the focus here is on the trumped up charges brought against him two decades before the Clinton compromise of ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell."" In the military, fraternizing with subordinates is one matter of concern; sex between men -- actual or presumed -- is tantamount to treason.Now it's Hatheway's turn, and he takes us from the cool marble of boyhood infatuation to the companionship of flesh without fatigues that also defines ""Special"" Forces.

The book carefully explains what the culture is (something that those who participate in it are often at a loss to describe), how it unintentionally excludes many of those whom individuals would probably approve of and relate to, and suggests alternative paths to creating a racially cohesive society. I highly recommend the book to anyone who wants to reach out to participate in the many rich cultures that our country provides.If you are like me, you've wondered what &quot;white culture&quot; studies are all about. Are they a closet attempt to re-establish &quot;white supremacy&quot; beliefs? In Lifting the White Veil, I found out that white culture studies are really about creating a more effective multiracial society that will benefit everyone.Although I felt like I had a good background in race-based sociology (having taken courses in the subject in both college and graduate school . . . and having been informed by many friends from other cultures about my cultural biases and limitations), I learned a lot . . . and was glad that I did.What the title refers to is that a dominant culture is usually invisible to those who participate in it, and limits their vision of what is going on around them. All such cultures are constricting though to other contiguous cultures, and we cannot understand those constrictions without understanding more about all cultures . . . including the dominant one.The author argues for a future in which white culture continues, but is no longer the dominant one that all others must kowtow to. Instead, he hopes that a multiracial culture will develop that will be superior to any existing culture.Jeff Hitchcock is the co-founder and executive director of the Center for the Study of White American Culture, a multiracial organization. As a self-described &quot;white American,&quot; he brings his own experiences to this study . . . which include being married to Ms. Charley Flint, a black feminist sociologist and raising their two children of color. The book's greatest strength for me was that Mr. Hitchcook openly describes the evolution of his own &quot;white&quot; and &quot;multiracial&quot; awarenesses while sharing some of the experiences that his multiracial family has had in the &quot;white&quot; culture.We are headed to a more multiracial society in the future as the percentage of those who are born from &quot;nonwhite&quot; races grows. It would make a lot of sense to know how to make the most of this experience. My own epiphany on the subject came when I took my sons to a Los Angeles Dodger game some years ago on &quot;Hispanic Day&quot; and found ourselves in the middle of enthusiastic Spanish-speaking fans in the left field bleachers. We had a wonderful time, and found it interesting to be in the minority in a large crowd for the first time in our lives. That epiphany is repeated whenever we are in Hawaii where people of many races live together without any one group being the majority. Most recently I was reminded of my epiphany at my father's funeral where most of his mourners were people from &quot;nonwhite&quot; communities . . . something that would have pleased him.For those who are not familiar with the history of racial culture in the United States, the book has a good summary description of how our concepts of race have changed over time. The book goes on to describe the latest sociological research and thinking on the subject of how to create a more just and engaged multiracial society.Be forewarned, however, that the book starts with a &quot;tough love&quot; lesson that will drive off casual readers. The book is much friendlier after that . . . if you don't mind finding out that you don't really have much multiracial experience.As I finished the book, I came away with a desire to know the other cultures in America much better. I'm sure you will have the same reaction.",Social Science
0761901434,Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design: Choosing among Five Traditions,,A3K72KF7FZF9YF,D. Collingridge,11/11,5.0,1165881600,A very good introduction to qualitative methods,"Creswell's book effectively covers basic theoretical and practical issues regarding biographies, phenomenology, grounded theory, ethnography, and case studies. I studied this book as a graduate student and now use parts of it in my research methods class. He avoids much of the qualitative jargon that so many other qualitative writers can't seem to avoid, thus making this book accessible to students who are not familiar with qualitative approaches. I especially like the convenient tables that summarize key points and the real-life articles in the appendix, one for each approach.There is plenty of information about qualitative research that is not included in the book. For instance, having personally spent a great deal of time reading and applying phenomenology, I can honestly say that there is much more to this technique (theoretically and practically) than what is discussed in the book. For this reason I do not believe that people can conduct expert qualitative research after reading just Creswell - I am sure that he would agree. Other resources are needed. But everyone has to begin somewhere, and Creswell's book is an excellent start.I would like to see an expanded version of this book; one that discusses each qualitative tradition in greater detail.DaveAfter reading some of the example articles at the back of the book I am of the opinion that these articles are the weak spot for this book. In particular, the ethnography article is a very long and old paper (circa 1972?) about school principals that is more a case study than an ethnography.

0716714884,The Discovery Of Subatomic Particles (Scientific American Library Series),,A1XE2JOZZKMEG6,Wikileaker,1/1,5.0,1300924800,Uniquely extraordinary intro and history of atomic/subatomic physics,"If a general reader were to take an interest in physics, and had time to devote to only a few books, this one by Professor Weinberg would be very near the top of the list. (this review pertains to the softcover edition published in 1990. about the only major change since then I am aware of is that the neutrino has been found to possess a small nonzero rest mass.)Ironically, Weinberg is a theoretical physicist (winner of Nobel Prize for his seminal contributions to the modern theory of the weak force and the Standard Model). Yet his book details the series of experimental discoveries in atomic and sub-atomic physics made (mostly) at the Cavendish Laboratory in Britain in the early 20th century.Weinberg begins chapter one with the historical notion of the atom, and also gives its modern understanding, which is the main concept to be developed throughout the course of the book. Then he introduces the setting of most of the book's action, the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge UK. For nonscientists, he presents a summary of units of scientific notation, which will be indispensible.Chapter two introduces the electron and its discoverer, J.J. Thomson. In a five-and-a-half ""flashback"" section (one of several in the book), he explains how the concept of electricity first arose back in ancient Greece and medieval Europe and proceeds with its historical development through the time of Ben Franklin up to Thomson's time. He notes that even today, triboelectricity is not well understood. Then electrical discharges produced in cathode ray tubes are presented as the first devices that could allow systematic study of electric currents. Even these were not well suited until effective vacuum pumps could evacuate the tubes sufficiently to eliminate the spurious effects of electron collisions with stray air molecules in the tube. It was noted that the glow and its shadows could be deflected by magnets and electrically charged plates, indicating that the rays were charged particles.Turning to Thomson's mathematical analysis of these projectiles, Weinberg goes into another four-page flashback to present the basics of Newton's laws of motion, then he takes up the thread again with Thomson's mathematical treatment of the deflection of cathode rays. He relates ""Unlike the electric force, the magnetic force acting on a particle is proportional to the particle's velocity as well as to its electric charge. Therefore, the displacement of the ray by magnetic forces depends on a different combination of ray-particle parameters than the displacement due to electric force. By measuring the deflections due to electric and to magnetic forces, Thomson was able to learn the values of two different combinations of ray-particle parameters, and in this way he could determine both the ray-particle velocities and the ratio of their charge and mass.""In another flashback, the facts of life pertaining to the electric force is presented (four and a half pages), then on to electric deflection of cathode rays, and a six page flashback on the magnetic force, and then the magnetic deflection of cathode rays. Finally, the results of Thomson's analysis is presented.Here Weinberg has to start over once again, as Thomson was not completely satisfied with his analysis of cathode ray deflection (although the data presented is reasonably consistent and convincing). ""He also employed another method based on measurements of heat energy deposited at the end of the tube."" Now Weinberg goes into a four and a half flashback to present the basics of the concept of energy, and then Thomson's results of this energy relations-based analysis. ""The cathode ray was directed into a small metal collector that would capture the electric charge of the ray particles and would also capture their kinetic energy, converting it to heat. The ratio of the heat energy and electric charge deposited in the collector then gives the ratio of the kinetic energy and the charge of each ray particle...Thomson had no idea of the detailed physical processes that occur when a cathode ray hits a metal collector, but he could be confident that the increase in heat energy of the collector had to be equal to the kinetic energy lost by the cathode-ray particles when they were stopped by the collector.""Finally, the idea of the cathode ray particles, now known as ""electrons"", as elementary particles, concludes chapter one. ""There was no way the existence of smaller particles within the atom could be verified on the basis of Thomson's 1897 experiments. Thomson did not claim that he had proved it, but there were a number of hints that led him to his far-reaching conclusions. The first was the universality of the measured ratios of mass to charge, [which] did not seem to depend on any of the circumstances under which it was measured...Thomson also quoted a result of Zeeman that indicated similar values of mass/charge ratio that characterized the electric currents in atoms that are responsible for the emission and absorption of light."" In a two page flashback the Zeeman effect is explained. Further, evidence indicated that the cathode ray particles bear similarities to the particles produced by the photoelectric effect, and their charges are of similar magnitudes to the ions produced by electrolysis. Although Kaufmann produced more accurate results than Thomson in similar experiments, only Thomson took the bold step of proposing the cathode ray particles as fundamental constituents of the atom because, not being an adherent of the ""Vienna Circle"" or applied logical positivism, ""he [Thomson] thought it was part of the business of physics to discover fundamental particles.""Chapter three, ""The Atomic Scale"", greatly broadens the range of topics covered. Weinberg makes the point that Thomson was unable to measure the charge or mass of the electron, only their ratio. Weinberg upps the stakes of the investigational effort by stating that ""The physicists and chemists of the 19th century had measured a great many other ratios of atomic properties...All that was needed was one good measurement of either the charge of the electron, the mass of the electron, or the mass or volume of any single atom, and all these ratios could be converted into values for the mass of the electron and the charge of the electron and the mass and volume of every sort of atom. In short, the scale of all atomic phenomena would then be known."" In my words, the very linchpin of atomic and molecular physics!In this chapter we get flashbacks on the foundational concepts of chemistry: atomic weights, Avagadro's molecular concept, and electrolysis. Then Weinberg proceeds with the work of Townsend and Wilson, with water droplets, which led directly to Millikan's measurement of the fundamental electronic charge with droplets of mineral oil.Chapter four, ""The Nucleus"", starts with the question of the source of the positive charge within the atom that is necessary to cancel out the negative charge of the electrons in order to make the atom electrically neutral. Thomson's own ""plum pudding"" model and Nagaoka's ""Saturnian"" model are suggested as candidates. But Weinberg must, of course, start at the beginning, and for the atomic nucleus, that was the discovery of radioactivity by Becquerel. Here Rutherford himself enters the picture, with his and Soddy's investigations of the alpha, beta, and gamma nuclear radiations. Weinberg goes into their discoveries of elemental transmutations, decay series, the displacement laws, elemental half-lives, and the particle characteristics of the three main nuclear radiations: alpha particles being essentially helium nuclei (and radioactive substances being strongly associated with helium gas), beta particles being the same as electrons, and gamma rays being high-energy light rays (the term ""photon"" was not then invented). Most astonishing about radioactivity were the calculations of the enormous energies that were being liberated. Even our friend Albert Einstein enters the picture here with the cameo appearance of his E=mc2 energy-mass equation, as it relates to the changes in atomic mass and the resulting liberation of energy in radioactive nuclei.At last we come to Rutherford's famous scattering experiment conducted by his students Geiger and Marsden, which revealed the atomic nucleus. Weinberg describes the surprising large-angle scattering of alpha particles by gold nuclei, and how Rutherford's interpretation of it led to his conclusion that a massive, positively charged particle called the nucleus dwells at the center of the atom. The correlation of atomic number with atomic weight comes next, followed by the explanation for variations in atomic weights among the elements; in other words, the isotopes. This, of course, brings us to the question of the internal constitution of the nucleus itself. The first step in this investigation was the discovery of the nuclear disintegration of nitrogen nuclei due to Rutherford, and his speculation of a neutrally-charged nuclear constituent. This, of course, brings us to the discovery of the neutron by Chadwick, accomplished due to his experiements with the beryllium rays. At last, Weinberg takes up the issue of the neutron as a fundamental particle. ""For Chadwick, as for Rutherford, the neutron was merely a composite of a proton and an electron...It is difficult to pinpoint the moment at which the neutron became accepted as a fully accredited elementary particle."" Weinberg explains the facts confounding this concept: the molecular spectra of the nitrogen molecule, the source of the beta particles in nuclear transformations (Fermi's theory of the weak force), and ever-finer measurements of the nuclear masses and the strong force (through nuclear scattering experiments). This chapter closes with a discussion of the map of the isotopes of all the elements, and how their lifetimes and stabilities vary with their binding energies and proton-neutron ratios.The concluding chapter, ""More Particles"", goes on to describe, in summary fashion only, subsequent discoveries in subatomic physics. These include: photons, neutrinos, the positron and other antiparticles, the ""heavy electrons"" (muon and tauon), the pion and the other mesons, the ""V-particles"" or strange particles (now known generally as hyperons), and the quarks. In the case of the neutrino, Weinberg briefly explains the problem of the missing energy in beta decay, and how it caused Pauli to hypothesize the neutrino, and how Fermi incorporated it and the new weak force into his theory of beta decay. In the case of the positron, Weinberg briefly explains how Dirac's relativistic quantum equation for the electron caused him to hypothesize the existence of positive energy states for the electron, which was confirmed by Anderson's discovery of the positron.Now, the reason I'm outlining the book in such detail is because I wish to emphasize the depth and breadth of Weinberg's coverage of these foundational principles. He introduces the history of each supporting concept from its very beginning and develops their evolutions from one idea to the next. The mathematical treatment is detailed and extensive, but totally arithmetic and algebraic -- no calculus! More exhaustive treatments are referred to in the book's 36 pages appendices, and again here no calculus! The most advanced math are the logarithmic and tangent functions. Weinberg takes care to make clear the units of measure involved with each equation presented.Each idea and the work of the entire community of physicists are explained in terms of the preceding ones, making clear how they interrelate and support one another. The narrative touches on so many foundational principles of physics so as to recommend itself as an outstanding way to introduce oneself to them.More than that, Weinberg makes plain the trains of thought that led the physicists to their hypotheses and interpretations of their experimental results. When you're a theorist, all you really need to know is theory (though of course being informed by experimental methods can only be helpful), but if you're an experimental physicist, you have to be good BOTH with your hands, and at the blackboard as well! Weinberg's presentation makes this fact stand out in stark relief.One thing I like about Weinberg's narrative is his awareness of the counterfactuals. When reading any history, it is all too easy to overlook the unknowns the principals had to confront in their thinking, and the choices they had to make. We now know that atoms are made of nuclei and electrons, and nuclei are made of protons and neutrons, and nucleons are made of quarks, etc. etc. But when these men were first looking deep into the atom with their primitive instruments, they had no idea of what they were looking for. Says Weinberg, ""This totting up of evidence gives an altogether misleading impression of the easiness of Rutherford's task in explaining the large-angle scatterings. A great many wrong explanations must have passed through his mind."" Weinberg also mentions difficulties in separating facts from confusing complications. ""Rutherford concluded that the particles responsible for the scintillations were the nuclei of hydrogen, which we now call protons. However, he did not know whether these protons were just recoiling nuclei from hydrogen atoms that happened to be present on the metal source and were struck by alpha particles, or whether they were actually knocked out of elements heavier than hydrogen.""The book is replete with drawings, diagrams, and photographs.As a detailed technical and conceptual history of atomic and sub-atomic physics, Weinberg's book stands, in my opinion, unrivalled. He explains its development with a thorough yet not-too-thorough mathematical treatment. This book has something for everyone whether they want to understand the experiments or the historical development of modern particle physics. As an introduction to the foundational concepts of physics, its breadth and depth recommends itself especially to the student physicist.",Science

This Western mythos centers on the desire for exploration. This desire was seen as far back as the Gilgamesh myth of the ancient Babylonians; and it emerged in American culture especially in Westward expansion and the related romance of the West. It entails a sense of wonder and the hope of encounter with the Sublime--elements undeniably evident in modern TV sci-fi, which are a major reason for their appeal. But imparting this sense of wonder and picturing the Sublime became possible only when TV technology improved from its first days. Only in recent years has TV arrived in an ""era where far-seeing 'tele-vision' can finally live up to its name"" by making use of ""brilliant colors and dynamic motion"" to enhance sf narratives. Today's TV science-fiction shows, notably ""Star-Trek,"" are contrasted with earlier ones such as ""Twilight Zone"" creating an atmosphere mainly by suggestion, leaving much to the viewer's imagination.

Fifty years after it first appeared, Asimov's Foundation series can still justifiably be called a classic. A clear influence on the Star Wars saga, and probably Star Trek as well, along with a large chunk of all science fiction that has come since. Sure there are a few things to quibble about with this series, and with this first book in particular. Asimov's vision of the distant future, with its nuclear reactors, microfilm communications, and picture phones, all seems ridiculously quaint today. As the story blasts through several decades, interchangeable characters come and go without making much of an impression, and this first book is so obviously part of a trilogy that it doesn't have a chance of standing on its own. But that's not the point, and by focusing on these quibbles you're missing the forest for the trees. Here Asimov has created a tremendous masterpiece of the imagination that is larger in scope than just about any other literary creation. The saga is built around the intriguing concept of psychohistory, in which the movements of huge masses of people can be accurately predicted over thousands of years (while it is still impossible to predict the actions of any one person). An ossifying empire, obviously based on the Roman Empire in its death throes, is on the verge of horrific collapse when the Foundation is created to subtly change the course of history behind the scenes, and gradually rises to prominence and tries to usher in a new golden age. The entire saga (not just this first book) takes place over a thousand years across a whole galaxy, while Asimov believably incorporates a full palate of psychology, politics, and sociology to lend the story credence. Still a masterpiece after all these years.",Education

The place in which it is located is important because it was in this time that World War II was being held in.This book is mostly about a Jewish girl named Patty Bergen short for Patricia who meets a man named Frederick Anton Reiker. This man is a German soldier who is being kept prisoner. Patty doesn't think of herself much until the day he changes her life upside down. Accompanying them in this miraculous book is her little sister named, Sharon who usually takes up everybodys attention and her nanny or servant named, Ruth. Ruth is like a mom and a dad for Patty.

0761901442,Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design: Choosing among Five Traditions,,A3K72KF7FZF9YF,D. Collingridge,11/11,5.0,1165881600,A very good introduction to qualitative methods,"Creswell's book effectively covers basic theoretical and practical issues regarding biographies, phenomenology, grounded theory, ethnography, and case studies. I studied this book as a graduate student and now use parts of it in my research methods class. He avoids much of the qualitative jargon that so many other qualitative writers can't seem to avoid, thus making this book accessible to students who are not familiar with qualitative approaches. I especially like the convenient tables that summarize key points and the real-life articles in the appendix, one for each approach.There is plenty of information about qualitative research that is not included in the book. For instance, having personally spent a great deal of time reading and applying phenomenology, I can honestly say that there is much more to this technique (theoretically and practically) than what is discussed in the book. For this reason I do not believe that people can conduct expert qualitative research after reading just Creswell - I am sure that he would agree. Other resources are needed. But everyone has to begin somewhere, and Creswell's book is an excellent start.I would like to see an expanded version of this book; one that discusses each qualitative tradition in greater detail.DaveAfter reading some of the example articles at the back of the book I am of the opinion that these articles are the weak spot for this book. In particular, the ethnography article is a very long and old paper (circa 1972?) about school principals that is more a case study than an ethnography. I think that Creswell could have selected a more recent paper that was a true ethnographic study. Also, the Grounded Theory paper on sexual victimization seems too depressing. The Phenomenological paper on the nurse-patient caring relationship is pretty good, however.",Social Science
0767404661,Applying Cultural Anthropology: An Introductory Reader,,A1B4NBFZJY2FIZ,Christopher Fung,16/17,5.0,980726400,"Excellent materials, great selection","First off, I'd like to agree with the first reviewer. This is an excellent compilation that stands by itself (although, for an intro class, it definitely requires a &quot;discipline-oriented&quot; text book like Kottak as a guiding force). I would recommend this book highly to my fellow anthros and to general readers alike. What follows is a brief summary of some of my favorite articles in the collection. The selections are all short and well-written, they make interesting and useful points and convey the complexity and utility of anthropology very, very well.I've been waiting a long time to see Peggy McIntosh's wonderful essay on &quot;White Privilege&quot; in print somewhere. I had the distinct pleasure of hearing her give an oral version of the same talk a number of years ago and am very very pleased to see it published here for the benefit of students. The book is worth the price for that article alone.However, this is not the only gem in this collection. Phillipe Bourgois' work on crack dealers is introduced here as is Gerald Murray's work on wood farming as a means to encourage re-forestation programs in Haiti. There are also classics such as Richard Lee's story of the !Kung San insulting of his gift of a Christmas ox (&quot;Eating Christmas in the Kalahari&quot;) and Laura Bohannon's failure to get Tiv elders to see Hamlet as a story about incest, revenge and justice. Jared Diamond's revisionist view of the advent of agriculture is also here (perhaps an antidote for his more recent &quot;Guns, Germs and Steel&quot; though undoutedly similar in style).Other personal favorites of mine include Eugene Cooper's discussion of Chinese table manners (also a must for people who want to teach a course on the anthropology of food), Richard Reed's examination of the tension between environmentalists and indigenous communities in Paraguay, Joan Cassels' excellent analysis of surgery as a male-gendered medical speciality and Paul Farmer's and Arthur Kleinman's thoughtful peice on suffering and AIDS in Haiti.Incidentally, I would thoroughly recommend anything by Paul Farmer to readers interested in social medicine. His scholarship and humanity are both quite phenomenal and totally justify the attention he has recieved due to the MacArthur fellowship.I only have a couple of quibbles with this book and even these are not so much criticisms as comments for the unwary: Jennifer Laab's peice on corporate anthropologists seems to have been written for a corporate audience as a selling point for anthropology. As such it plays up the notion of anthropologists as service providers for corporate interests in a way which is a little frown-inducing for an academician such as myself. Not because I don't approve of anthropology in the private sector, but because the peice itself seems to argue that anthropology is merely a set of techniques that can be workshopped (like team-building exercises)to busy executives for the greater good of the company. Again, this is a VERY worthwhile point to debate, but not one that easily stands without comment. Secondly, the article by Wade Davis (he of &quot;Serpent and the Rainbow&quot; fame), while again discussion-worthy, seems a little superficial, dated in language and probably replaceable (Robert Voeks'recently-published &quot;Sacred Leaves of Candomble&quot; is one alternative that springs to mind). Lastly, I would like to plead for the inclusion of a selection on tatooing or bodily adornment of some sort in any future editions. This is a topic of enduring interest among students and would definitely be an asset to such a nicely-balanced and valuable collection.",Social Science

In this book Creswell clearly and logically lays out five different qualitative research traditions (1. a biographical life history; 2. a phenomenology; 3. a grounded theory study; 4, an ethnography; and 5. a case study). Creswell guides researchers on the rationale for each method, the design, and corresponding data collection, analysis and narrative report, while giving ample references for further reading in one's chosen tradition. Particularly helpful are the appendices that include example studies of each methodology.I needed other sources to supplement what I learned here, but this book really gave me an excellent foundation with which to proceed.

B0007ERZKW,Burton;: A biography of Sir Richard Francis Burton,,A1DWG10K1FHL37,"Daniel Graf ""Daniel Graf""",17/18,5.0,1144627200,A Primer in Burtonology,"Burton by Byron Farwell is the fourth biography of Sir Richard Francis Burton that I have read -- I might have a little bit of an obsession. But, in my defense, since I want to BE him, it is necessary to do the research. Burton was a giant among the several 19th century explorers of Africa and the Middle East, a brilliant linguist and a prolific (if prolix) geographer and scientist.As emphasized by Farwell, Burton is most fascinating in his complexity, in the numerous conflicts that comprised his character. Burton longed to suffer the fevers and hardship associated with an overland caravan, but he could not tolerate (without copious complaints) the minor inconveniences of more civilized travel. Throughout his life, he remained loyal to Queen and Country, while at the same time confrontationally challenging the policies and patients of his supervisors in the Foreign Office. A student of all religions but practitioner of none, he married a woman for whom her God was everything. Burton vigorously sought fame and fortune through his actions and endeavors, but he could never come up with a consistent plan -- instead, he favored get-rich-quick schemes. Eventually, he was knighted and struck it big with his publication of A Thousand Nights and a Night, and then... he died.Of the Burton biographies that I have studied, Farwell's treatment has certain advantages for the amateur Burtonologist. The prose is well written, fast paced and insightful. The details are ably researched and the author comes off as an unbiased admirer without an agenda beyond trying to understand the Man. Other volumes on Burton, while more dense and scholarly, tend to be a bit more slanted.",Biography & Autobiography

I feel that this story was better that some, because it was based on real life experiences from the life of the author, Charlotte Bronte.The story has a good amount of suspense that keeps the reader wanting to find out what happens next.I highly recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys old English books from the late 1800's, and to romance novel readers!~SUMMARY~Jane Eyre is orphaned as an infant, and left to the guardianship of her Aunt Reed. There at Gateshead Hall, she is horribly mistreated by the Reeds, against the dying wish of her Uncle Reed.At the age of 10, Jane is accepted to Lowood School after being interviewed by the schools owner: Mr. Brocklehurst. Jane takes an instant disliking to him, and when she arrives at the school, he stands Jane on a pedestal and tells everyone that she is a liar, which is not true. She later proves to everyone that she is not a liar. During her time at the school, Jane meets a girl named Helen Burns. They immediately become best friends, to the very end. Sadly, this end comes all too soon. Helen is one of the 7 fatal cases during the typhus epidemic at the school. Jane remains at the school for a good 10 years, 2 of which were spent as a teacher, until she advertised as a governess.Jane's advertisement is answered by a Mrs. Fairfax, of Thornfeild Hall. Jane arrives to meet her pupil: Adel&eacute;, a French little girl, who was left to Mr. Rochester by her mother. Mr. Rochester is the master of the Thornfeild estate, and first meets Jane when she assists him and his spooked horse on a lane one afternoon. By this time, Jane has been at Thornfeild for a few months. Mrs. Fairfax had previously informed Jane that she will rarely see Mr. Rochester, as he sometimes leaves for days, weeks or even months at a time. Mr. Rochester then accuses her of being a witch and casting a spell on his horse, and then asks her some questions, learning that she is his newly appointed governess.When Jane returns to Thornfeild Hall, she sees the dog she encountered earlier, and discovers that the stranger from the road is Mr. Rochester himself when he calls for her later that evening.Evening talks become a daily habit, and both characters fondness for each other grows...One night, Mr. Rochester returns home with group of friends he has invited to stay. There Jane meets Blanche Ingram, one of the many people who treat her as if she is a servant, whom everyone expects Mr. Rochester will marry, although she is only attracted to his money.That night, another guest, Mr. Mason, is badly injured, but Jane is not told how, only that she must care for his wounds in silence until the doctor arrives. Jane assumes this has to do with the strange and violent Grace Poole.During Jane's stay at Thornfeild, Jane witnesses a series of strange happenings, as well as a strange laugh she will hear periodically at night. These are said to be the doings of a drunken servant named Grace Poole.Jane then receives a letter from Gateshead Hall, telling her that Mrs. Reed is requesting Jane to come visit her on her death bed. There she learns that a distant Uncle Eyre wished to adopt Jane, but Mrs. Reed replied saying that Jane died in the Typhus epidemic.Jane returns from Gateshead Hall 3 weeks late because of funeral arrangements for her aunt to an anxious Mr. Rochester, who feared her to never return. Later, in the garden, he asks Jane to marry him, and she gladly accepts, to the dismay of Mrs. Fairfax.The wedding was interrupted by a man who announced that Mr. Rochester was already married! Mr. Rochester then confesses as he brings the wedding attendees up to his attic. There he shows everyone his ""wife:"" Bertha Mason, an insane and deadly violent woman, looked over by Grace Poole. She is kept there because Mr. Rochester doesn't have the heart to send her to an asylum.In her dismay, Jane runs away from Thornfeild Hall. Leaving her belongings in a stage coach by accident, she has no other option other than to become a beggar or die on the streets.She finnally is taken into the Rivers residence. Here St. John, and his 2 sisters care for her, and she becomes like one of the family. She later learns that John Eyre (the uncle from the letter) has died and left Jane his fortune. During this, she learns that the Rivers are her cousins. She shares the fortune with them.St. John repeatedly asks her to marry him and join him as a missionary during her time there. They both know he does not love her, but he thinks Jane would be a good missionary wife.One night, Jane hears Mr. Rochester's voice calling to her, and runs from St. Johns house to Thornfeild Hall. There she finds the estate burned to the ground. Bertha had set fire to it and Mr. Rochester was blinded when he unsuccessfully tried to save her life.Jane and Mr. Rochester, never losing any feelings for each other during their time apart, then marry.",Literary Criticism

B0007DMFAS,The long season,,AJH0Q26B0DNGY,Bruce Baskin,3/3,4.0,1249948800,Terrific baseball diary by a literate and observant pitcher,"Although ""The Long Season"" predates ""Ball Four"" by ten years, it's been all but forgotten by baseball fans in general. And that's too bad.When Jim Brosnan wrote ""The Long Season,"" he was 29 years old and approaching the midway point of a respectable major league pitching career. Brosnan was entering his first full season with the St. Louis Cardinals when he wrote his diary of the 1959 season, but was traded to the Cincinnati Reds during the year.Lots of people compare ""The Long Season"" with ""Ball Four,"" which is unfair to both because you're comparing apples to oranges. Although ""Ball Four"" is in general a funnier book than ""The Long Season"" (and more profane by far...there is little swearing and no sexual escapades in ""The Long Season,"" making it safe for your 10-year-old nephew Billy to read), I think Broz's book is a little bit more literate and urbane...and please don't take that as a knock on Bouton. This is not as breezy a read as anything Bouton has written, but it's worth digging a little deeper to see what's going on. The humor is a little more subtle, too. Where Bouton might have simply made some wise comment about Frank Crosetti giving a convoluted speech about sign language from the third-base coach's box, Brosnan writes what Johnny Keane actually said and lets it stand without comment. The same point is made, but with a different methodology.I give this one four stars because (as one reviewer notes) it CAN drag a little in places, but ""The Long Season"" isn't that far behind ""Ball Four"" as the best baseball diary ever written...and it's better than diaries also written by Sparky Lyle, Bill Freehan and others. A very good book, but not necessarily something that will appeal to a peripheral baseball fan. If you are really into the game, however, go ahead and buy this one. You won't be disappointed.Then buy Brosnan's ""Pennant Race,"" his book about the 1961 Cincinnati Reds.",Sports & Recreation

I did not find it so in the least. Basically, young Miss Chudleigh impulsively elopes with Augustus Hervey and soon afterwards they part for good. Many years later she marries the Duke of Kingston without divorcing Hervey basically to avoid the scandal of divorce. The ""highlight"" of the book is her trial for bigamy, more than 35 years after leaving Hervey and some years after the Duke's death (the charge initiated by the Duke's disinherited nephew). Before and after her conviction, the story concentrates on her legal problems, her travels and her interest in buying up property -- I could barely slog through the second half of the book and admit to skimming some of it.I am very interested in 18th century English history and have read all the popular history I could find, especially biographies of fashionable ladies like the Duchess of Devonshire, Mrs. Fitzherbert, Mrs. Jordan, Countess of Bessborough, Lady Caroline Lamb, among others.

Strong,1/1,5.0,1181779200,All history should be so gripping.,"If everyone could write history like Philbrick, we'd have more history majors than you could count. To be fair, much of what makes this particular effort so page-turning is the story that Philbrick selects, but he deserves credit for smart selection too.This book recounts the tale of about 25 young men setting out from Nantucket in 1819 for a whaling voyage that would take them around the tip of South America and into the Pacific Ocean and was expected to last as long as two years - pretty typical for the time. Unfortunately for them, they would undergo a trial that would be so amazing that it would become the basis for Melville's Moby Dick.The Whaleship Essex is attacked by an 85 foot Sperm Whale, and sunk. The crew of the ship get into three small whale boats and attempts to sail more than 1,000 miles to the coast of South America after deciding against closer islands for fear of cannibals (there is a very grim irony in this later in the story).I won't tell you any more of the story, because it's far too fun to have it unfold for yourself as you read. I will say that the story itself is amazing and Philbrick puts you right in the middle of the action with his narrative and use of the notes of the men who were there. In the midst of the drama, you come away learning quite a bit about a way of life that has long since vanished.The way history should be - having the feel of a being about people just like us, but in wholly different circumstances. Highly recommended.",History

Unlike many of the biographies on the bookshelves of the national chains these days, this biography was not written to sell so much as to inform and enlighten. The author gives us a very close glimpse of Carver, from his youth through his college years and professional life. The reader feels as though he has met this man at one time or another because the author has presented Mr Carver's progression and accomplishments through life in a very human light. There are constant reminders of the motives behind Carver's decisions and actions which stem from his personal Christian belief that he is on mission to fulfill a purpose and find meaning in his life and career by serving others. I believe that this biography is very informative and does great service to a great man by accurately presenting the facts of his life and his deepest feelings and thoughts. This book was written at a time before the onslaught of cheap biographies which are now published to entice the reader with ""national enquirer"" style gossip and political correctness, the sole purpose being to ring the cash register.

Jane Eyre was summer reading, and I figured he could knock out this assignment on our trip AND we could have some fun talking about it. This plan worked out wonderfully. The narration was great and we had some good discussions.One area that I made my son nuts was complaining about the character of Edward Rochester. I look at his behavior, and cannot understand why so many readers consider him a romantic hero.He treats women terribly. He ignores the emotional needs of Ad&egrave;le Varens. While it is noble that he pays for her care while his paternity is not clear, he has assumed the role of guardian and is not emotionally present for her.Next, Lady Ingram is a narcissistic gold digger. At the same time, she is a feeling human being (in the context of the story). Rochester just uses her to make Jane jealous. He gets Lady Ingram to dump him by telling her a lie when posing as a gypsy fortune teller. This is not an honorable way to end a relationship.He does his worst to Jane. He knows full well that he is already married. Yes, he really does not like Bertha Mason Rochester. No, he really REALLY does not like Bertha Rochester. But, he is legally married to Bertha and he knows it.We find that his plan is to wed her, take her on a honeymoon, ruin her for other men (by the standards of the time), and then drop the bombshell on her that he is already married and that their marriage is not legal.So why do so many women seem to overlook how badly Rochester was going to treat Jane and love this is a romantic story.

B0007DMFAS,The long season,,A2U974OZOVRT7A,Tom Without Pity,2/2,5.0,1248220800,Groundbreaking Generously Written Baseball Diary,"The Long Season by Jim Brosnan was the first of the baseball insider's diary type of books that was actually written by major league relief pitcher Jim Brosnan.This diary of his 1959 National League season was not whispered into a tape recorder, it was actually written, pen to paper during the 1959 season by up and coming relief pitcher Jim Brosnan.The Long Season details the failures and triumphs of pitching relief in the Major Leagues by a young man who seems to be on the verge of becoming a bullpen star if he could just gain control of what he throws and, at the same time, have his manager and coaches believe that he is able do the job.It also details the lives and careers of his bullpen cohorts, some of whom are banished to the minor leagues and replaced with other pitchers starving for a taste of life at the major league level.Brosnan's diary also reveals his relationship with the media people, both writers and announcers, who's job it is to bring the game to ""all those wonderful fans."" For those of us who have been around for a while, it is a little jarring to hear one broadcaster usually referred to as ""beloved"" described here as ""old tomato face,"" but that's the business of professional sports or the business of anything else, I guess.The Long Season was published in 1960 and although Brosnan never reallyslammed anyone it was a controversial book for its time. Brosnan took a fair amount of heat on and off the field for the book but it remains as the standard for sports diarys so far as I am concerned.I think, however, the best part of The Long Season is the section when Jim Brosnan, up and coming relief pitcher, is traded from a young team, thought to be on he rise, to a team with established stars, trying to stay in the pennant race one more season.A startling development to our hero and his young family and an upsetting personal experience to say the least. I think that Brosnan demonstrates vividly that while a trade like this is routine to most fans, it can be a shattering experience to the actual players and the families involved.As I have said, The Long Season is a groundbreaking book and still is an entertaining read to anyone who likes baseball. In the history of the game, this 50-year old diary has proven to be an invaluable, entertaing record of the way it was.",Sports & Recreation

The main character is twelve-year-old Patty Bergen, a Jewish girl growing up during World War II. She lives in a small Arkansas town, where her parents own a department store. The federal government has chosen her town as the location for a camp for Nazi prisoners of war. Although most Jewish Americans despise the Germans for what they have done to Jews in Europe, Patty regards the prisoners of war with more curiosity than hatred.The Nazi soldiers are used to pick cotton in the fields of the rural South, and they are brought to Patty's father's store to pick out hats to protect their faces from the hot sun. Only one of them can speak English, and so he interprets for the entire group. The interpreter's name is Frederick Anton Reiker, known to his friends as Anton. Patty is present when the soldiers arrive at the store, and she waits on Anton, who wants to buy a pencil sharpener. They become friends in this short length of time.Patty has many problems with her family. Her parents never show her any love or kindness. Her mother, who is very beautiful, is always finding faults with Patty's appearance, and her father outright hates her. She has to endure beatings and whippings from him several times. Patty has very few friends, and her closest friend is Ruth, an African-American woman hired to be the housekeeper and cook for the Bergens. Patty also loves her sister Sharon, even though Sharon receives a lot of love and attention from the girls' parents, and of course there is Anton. She isn't good friends with the other girls in their town because of the ever-present barrier of religion.Anton manages to escape from the prisoners' camp and makes his way to Patty's home. She shelters him in a forgotten suite of rooms above the family's detached garage, and brings him food and clothing daily. During this time period, their friendship deepens. Anton witnesses one of the beatings that Patty's father was giving her, and tried to rush to her aid. When Patty is talking to him after this episode, she realizes that she has never loved her parents, particularly her father, and that they are cruel to her. However, her time with Anton can't last. He feels that he is threatening Patty's safety by staying with her, and so he leaves.Over the next few months, Patty has to deal with many crushing losses, especially one concerning Anton. She draws strength from a ring he gave her before parting, which was his most treasured possession. She also learns to accept that her parents cannot and will never love her, but she realizes that it isn't because of her faults that her parents hate her--it is because of their pettiness and narrow-mindedness.I recommend this book to anyone.

B000PBZH6Q,Foundation,,A21HKDOW2FWVX,Dustin R.T.,7/9,2.0,1330300800,Vapid Interaction on a Skeleton of a World,"Disclaimer: I am judging this book as a standalone piece of work.Isaac Asimov's Foundation is the first of a series that would eventually be considered a cornerstone of the Sci-Fi genre. While it is certainly a solid piece of work, I don't quite understand how it is deserving of such praise. In my opinion, it suffers from an abundance of poor storytelling techniques, which reduce what is a great concept to a finished product that left me feeling empty. In fact, I struggled to finish the final pages, nearly racing through it solely for the sake of completion. I have rarely, rarely done this before. I'll start with the good aspects along with plot setup type-stuff first, and then finish with the overwhelmingly bad.The ideas and concepts behind Foundation are wonderful. The basis of the book is the work of Hari Seldon, the master practitioner of a discipline called psychohistory. If executed correctly, psychohistory has the ability to predict behavior of human beings thousands and thousands of years in advance through a combination of many disciplines, including mathematics, statistics, and psychology. It is, in essence, what modern day economics aspires to be. Being an economics major who currently works in the field, I found this to be highly compelling. In fact, it was from a blog post suggestion by Paul Krugman that I picked the book up in the first place.A bit more of the plot: Hari Seldon, the well-known psychohistorian, seeks to avoid an extended Dark Age, a period of 30,000 years in which barbarism runs rampant and tons of information is lost. His work in psychohistory leads to the establishment of the Foundation, which send ripples through the universe and ultimately attempts to shape its fate for the better. Hari Seldon is the first of a string of highly intelligent characters you'll meet, and Foundation is saturated with clever and thought-provoking dialogue amongst these characters. This, unfortunately, is where the good stuff ends.To say that this book is saturated with dialogue is a vast understatement. This book is 95% dialogue and it is the vehicle through which the story is told. This, I found to be abysmal. Even with an omniscient narration technique at hand, rare are the thoughts of characters, their descriptions, or an inkling of the settings on which these dialogues are taking place. One of the largest structural weakness of this storytelling style is that Asimov must infuse important details into his conversations. The problem with this is that these are details that would never come up in normal conversation. Thus, they come off as very awkward and ultimately serve to cheapen the dialogue. Not being able to get into the minds of characters leaves too much unsaid, which is the part of the cause of every section having the same structure: Person A is the plotter, Person B is the questioner. Person A knows something that Person B doesn't, Person B continually questions Person A about his plans, which all finally ends with a ""Don't you see?"" moment by Person A in which he explains his elaborately constructed conspiracy to Person B. This is the essence of every single section. By the time you get to the end, nothing is unexpected.And worse still, every single character is similar (except for one, who speaks with an accent and makes for a very comical section of the book). They are all intelligent, but not wholly different. Their lack of physical descriptions and thoughts serve to make them feel like the same lifeless replica of one another. The nature of the story, which causes there to be major gaps in time, make this even more egregious because just as you are getting used to one character, his section ends and a new character has replaced him. I felt zero emotion for these characters. As for the setting, this universe is not a living, breathing world. It is merely the outline of one, a skeleton of what could have been something magnificent. This bothers me. I am confident when I say that this book would have been absolutely stunning if Asimov had included 100 pages more of thoughts, descriptions, and settings.Some other small gripes: Asimov is prone to overusing adverbs, usually considered a literary sin. Foundation also has not aged well in terms of technology, as Asimov really misses on a lot of advancements that it seems other Sci-Fi authors were able to catch. I do not take any points off off this review for that, however, because the predictions he did make were far better than any I could have ever fathom, and I commend him in that regard. All I'm saying is that these misses, relative to other authors, aren't helping.",Education
0394779959,Summer of My German Soldier,,A16QODENBJVUI1,Robert Moore,7/9,5.0,1197331200,An adult's review of an excellent book,"My daughter is now too older and far too accomplished a reader in her own right to need or want me to read to her, but I wish I had known of this when we were still reading together. I read this for a couple of reasons. As a native of Little Rock I wanted to read what is perhaps the most celebrated juvenile novel to have come out of my home state. Second, I have seen it highly praised and wanted to see if the praise was justified.The praise was indeed justified. The novel is about a 12-year-old Jewish girl living in a small fictional town in northeastern Arkansas named Jenkinsville. As far as I can guess it is somewhere between Forrest City and Memphis. Wynne is mentioned as a nearby town. Looking at a map I would guess Jenkinsville is approximately where Parkin, Arkansas is. The protagonist of the novel is Patty Bergen, who is as isolated as a child can be. Her mother is unrelentingly critical of her while her father is both dismissive and physically abusive. At the time of the action of the novel she is virtually friendless as well, with most of her friends off at Baptist summer camp in the Ozarks (as any Arkansas Baptist would know, Siloam Springs). And as a member of the only Jewish family in town, she feels religious alienation as well. In the course of the novel only a few people seem friendly toward her at all. Her grandparents in Memphis give her a kind of love that her parents deny her. The black family maid and cook acts as a sort of real parent that her parents seem incapable of being. A Memphis newspaper reporter accords a level of respect to her that few others seem capable of. And, surprisingly, the town sheriff seems truly compassionate. But most of all a young twenty-year-old German prisoner of war helps her more than anyone else believe that she is ""a person of worth."" The book is filled with ironies as the two people who help her most with her sense of self-esteem are a black maid and a German prisoner, just as it is ironic that his is most aided by that same black maid and a young Jewish girl.This is a deeply affecting, moving novel. Patty is a deeply flawed, yet wonderfully realistic character. She has a habit of telling petty lies that partly serve to garner her respect that others deny her and partly to force others to pay attention to her. The scene in which she is forced to go for a horrible perm on a blisteringly hot day is a chillingly vivid and realistic portrait of what would seem like hell to a small girl.As others have noted, this is on many levels a sad book. But it is also, I think, an optimistic one. One can't help but believe that Anton, Patty's German soldier, was right: Patty is a person of worth. It is difficult to believe that she didn't turn out well after the events of the novel and that what made this possible for her was what others helped her realize about herself. In the short run, one imagines things got worse for her. As Ruth, the black maid, told her, her parents were ""irregular"" or ""seconds,"" meaning that just as some pieces of clothing were sold cheaply because they didn't measure up, so Patty's parents never had and never would measure up. One can sense that Patty's home life remained bleak and unhappy, but that she still was going to turn out all right. She was, she had learned, a person of worth.I recommend this to adults as well as younger readers, but I especially recommended parents reading it to their children. It isn't just a great read, it raises a host of difficult and fascinating questions.Note: I was right! I just read an article about Bette Greene and learned that she was raised in Parkin, Arkansas. I think it is safe to assume that Parkin is the real Jenkinsville.",Juvenile Fiction

This is a superb book to use if you want a general introduction to biology. One improvement in the 6th is the use of dictionary symbols in the glossary, so pronunciation is now unambiguous.However, one wonders why such talented writers and teachers would allow such a poor physical package to carry their name. No bows here!The book is approximately 1250 pages long. While the previous, 5th edition used small type - making it hard enough to read - the 6th edition now uses a lighter even harder to read type. The book is also quite heavy and awkward, and is best read at a table or desk. Its physical size is more suitable for an encyclopedia than a text.Three other minor issues:To find the pronunciation of new unfamiliar technical terms one must turn to the glossary in the back of the book, an awkward process with a book this size. Perhaps, in the next edition, the authors will consider providing pronunciation information where new terms are first presented as well as in the glosary.The enclosed CD is a nice touch with enough variety to keep it interesting. However, some more care needs to be given to matching it appropriately to the book. For example, the activity for Heritable Information for Chapter One presents numerous chemical concepts not yet covered, and is clearly inappropriate at this point in the book.While the form of the glossary is improved, some pronunciations (plantae, deoxyribonucleic, etc.) still do not appear to match those of standard dictionaries or rules for scientific pronunciation.In summary, this is a superb book to learn from whether in or outside a class. Its major problems relate to its seriously flawed physical layout. It cries out to be split into two volumes, and for many of the gratuitous pictures to be pruned so room for more readable type is available.The books content easily deserve five stars - the rating here.

Oh, the idea intrigues me, surely, that of humankind eons in the future existing across the galaxy on a multitude of worlds, so far removed from earth that eminent masters of science themselves debate whether earth was even the planet where human life began, but once the dust settled from an idea that lofty, what did Asimov really DO with it? He used it for unexciting little tales of science v. military might. I love the parallel between the fall of this vast space empire and the fall of Rome. The way bands of scientists struggled in a dark age to keep the light of knowledge alive was thought-provoking (which is high praise in my lexicon) but this was backdrop, and the plot Asimov employed in telling the story of all this was (sorry to say) dull, slow, simple, and unworthy of the imaginative concepts he thought up in his setting for this tale of knowledge overcoming strength of arms. I haven't read the later Foundation novels, so maybe they're the ones where the brilliance of the series exists, but I found this book from Sci-Fi's golden age so demanding on my patience that I didn't finish it the first time I tried to read it and barely made it to the end the second time.

0394779959,Summer of My German Soldier,,A10K8INOCHMHXU,"Reese Witherspoon ""Lane""",4/4,5.0,1145836800,Summer of My German Soldier Book Review,"The historical fiction novel, Summer of My German Soldier, written by Bette Greene, describes the cultural aspects of daily life during World War II. This novel published by The Penguin Group in 1973 was a finalist in the National Book Award and won an ALA Notable Book award. This book takes place in Jenkinsville, Arkansas during World War II. Throughout this novel times are tense for the protagonist Patty Bergen, because she risks losing family, friends, and her freedom, for whom she dearly loves, Anton Reiker. Summer of My German Soldier is a very descriptive and educating historical fiction novel, which sets this book apart from others in many different ways, including its setting, content, and themes. This novel did not include information about the war as most World War II books do, that making this novel more unique. Many believe that the theme ""longing for love"" really stands out in this novel. Throughout this novel Patty is longing for her parents to find appreciation in Patty and to love her as others do. This is one of very few books in which exemplify such love in a World War II set book. Also, Bette Greene makes this novel so interesting by creating a character, such as Patty who is so lively and modern. Many readers of Summer of My German Soldier believe that the major purpose of this book is to see each other as real people with wonderful qualities, and to love each other for what they are and not for what people label them as. The appropriate reader for this novel would be 12 and up and people who love a mix of historical fiction and romance.Summer of My German Soldier is organized in an orderly manner, conflicting with great drama and a thrilling plot. The illustrator Robert Hunt did a great job on the front cover of this novel. The image shows Anton holding Patty gently on a cloudy summer afternoon. Anton Reiker, the Nazi prisoner of war shows signs of awareness and how much he cares about Patty, while Patty shows trust in Anton, her lover. The layout of this novel is so well thought out, including the photos, the table of contents, and the text.Bette Greene definitely achieved her purpose in writing this young adult novel, for this book taught many readers a life lesson, which is to realize that we can't classify people as good or bad because of their nationality, race, or religion. Summer of My German Soldier captures important aspects of the 1940's such as the horrors of World War II. Summer of My German Soldier is a fascinating young adult piece of literature. Those who enjoy reading historical fiction novels and those who enjoy romantic novels will absolutely adore this book. Though, if you are the fantasy type of reader, I do not recommend this book to you. It enhances your historical knowledge, while at the same time, you sit back and enjoy a teenage ""love story"".",Juvenile Fiction

Then Nolwyn dies and the only thing Ahern has left to keep is Tanith. Ahern starts living with his second wife. She wants to keep Ahern all to herself and soon enough the whole clan is against Tanith. Beneath her heart, Tanith is craving for the wolves but Gibran, a pledge son is holding her back from going with them. How can Tanith live through this type of mockery and evil? But how can she leave Gibran, who wants to marry her? She only has five days to decide where her love will stay and whether peace can be with her once again. Troubled, puzzled and totally losing her mind Tanith has to think fast before her time is up. Trapped between the two worlds in her heart, Tanith is forced to choice between them. So she runs away to the wolves. The thing I liked most about this book is that this story is actually telling you that wolves and humans are equivalent in the ways you would least expect. When I say this I mean that wolves are a clan and people are a clan, and that wolves can respect you and people can respect you but, in their own type of way. In reading this book, I learnt allot about the habits and behaviour of wolves.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""",9/9,5.0,1214352000,A man of no property,"Family secrets, dirty little problems, gambling, divorce, illegitimate babies and a dash of adultery, scandal and forbidden love. Soap opera?Not exactly. It's Nobel Prize Winner John Galsworthy's sprawling family epic ""The Forsyte Saga,"" a three-volume saga that spans the nouveau riche Forsyte clan, and the devastating events that threaten their ever-respectable facade. Galsworthy's lush writing and intricate, insightful stories are excellent on their own, but the dignified handling of 19th-century laws and mores -- and how they changed -- add an extra dimension to his writing.While it has a distinctly soapy flavor, ""Saga"" retains its dignity and look at turn-of-the-century mores and society.The Forsyte family is determinedly regal and hard-nosed, almost to the point of a fault. And as the story begins, the Forsyte family has come together to celebrate June Forsyte's engagement to a young bohemian architect, Philip Bosinney -- except for June's father, who eloped with the governess and is now shunned by his family.Among the guests are the stuffy, domineering Soames Forsyte and his quiet, unhappy wife Irene -- though she conditionally agreed to marry him, she doesn't love him. But Soames regards Irene as his most valuable piece of property, even as she begins an ill-fated affair with Bosinney. At the same time, the patriarch Jolyon starts to kick off family disapproval, and goes to see his estranged son.Soames' determination to ""own"" Irene leads to tragedy for all three of them, and Irene and Soames separate for the next decade. But when Soames demands a divorce so he can marry a French girl, he finds himself obsessed and stalking Irene once again. And as before, Soames' harassment drives his estranged wife into the arms of another man -- his disgraced cousin Young Jolyon. And even as Soames gains a new woman, he finds that you don't get everything you want...A new complication enters the works almost two decades later -- Soames' daughter Fleur is immediately attracted to Irene's son Jon. The two start an innocent romance, unaware of their parents' past together, but still overshadowed by the loathing and shame Soames and Irene have for each other. An aristocratic suitor for Fleur, mysterious letters and a secret love affair all come to the surface, as Fleur and Jon discover that love isn't always enough to overcome the bitterness of the past...The Forsyte Saga is indeed a saga -- it stretches from the stuffy Victorian era into the first bloom of the roaring twenties. Despite the early claim that Forsytes would never die, various characters age, die and weave new lives for themselves, and grapple with a rapidly changing world -- including the new rights for women as individuals, rather than ""property.""The first part was written in a time before the world of England's upper crust changed forever -- sort of an English ""Age of Innocence."" And while Galsworthy's first trilogy can be seen as the story of an obsession, it can also be seen as the portrait of the Forsytes overall -- stuffy, gilded, and eager to forget the working class roots a few generations back.Galsworthy paints this time in a flurry of lush, dignified prose , filled with slightly mocking notes about the Forsyte family, and tiny gestures and expressions that convey more than actual dialogue could (""Huddled in her grey fur against the sofa cushions, she had a strange resemblance to a captive owl"") and lushly written descriptives (""... over the lush grass fell the thick shade from those fruit trees planted by her father five-and-twenty years ago"").Yet there are touching moments too, like Old Jolyon paying a visit to his estranged son and his lower-class second wife, and the grandchildren he has never met. The awkwardness, love and pain in these scenes is truly astounding.As for the main characters of this drama, Galsworthy handles their passions and involvements delicately and with dignity. No soap opera dramatics -- just a married woman in love with her best pal's fiance, and who is raped by her angry husband. And then a realist's version of ""Romeo and Juliet,"" if Romeo and Juliet's parents were exes and no suicides came into it.Soames and Irene are really at the center of this book -- she remote, quiet and something of a mystery even to the readers, and he a selfish, close-minded man who wants to ""own"" people. Their children are far more endearing -- Fleur is passionate and vivacious, and Jon is sensitive and sweet. But there's a vast cast of interesting characters in the Forsyte family, especially melancholy Young Jolyon and his artistic daughter June.Bitterness, obsession and love fill the pages of the ""Forsye Saga,"" and provide the start of a truly classic trilogy of great novels.",Fiction

For every chart that shows a meaningful pattern, there are 5 that show no pattern at all. The technician, out of necessity of his methodology, is forced to make meaning of a chart which is likely just a random collection of observations. Just because a price happened to bottom or top twice consecutively at the same point doesn't mean that there's 'support' or 'resistance' at that level. Sometimes there are legitimate support and resistance levels, but more often than not, those are illusory. Support or resistance levels evaporate and reset all the time.Fundamental analysis puts the investor in a much better position to actually succeed in my opinion. Earnings, price, book value, growth, forward earnings, debt levels, etc. are not subject to any interpretation. They are what they are. It might take any given stock a long time for it to align w/ its fundamental valuation, but the relative predictability that one sees in P/E levels for different types of businesses of varying sizes and growh prospects makes the fundamental school the more rational approach.Also, anyone who believes that markets are 'efficient' hasn't paid much attention to markets. Lacking a material event (earnings release, management shake-up, etc.) a company's price will largely be pulled around in lock-step w/ the broader market.These are known as the facts.

Navratil,10/13,4.0,1237334400,Great book - accompanying code is architecturally stale - Linux not included,"This book is a classic and remains a very valuable conceptual guide. While the text seems to be up-to-date, the accompanying code suffers from the age of the environment in which is was originally written and has not been ported to Linux. I write this review from the Linux point of view as I am not programming in the Sun or BSD environment.I purchased the book with the idea of learning pty programming for Fedora. While the chapter was very informative in its discussions, using the man pages is required. As the source code accompanying the book doesn't address Linux, per se, and one may be tempted to use the apue.linux3.tar.Z download with its Red Hat port of the common library. Downloading it may be helpful, but the added code was written for Red Hat 6 and the book is newer than that. Specifically, the pty open code was not functional and I reverted to the svr4 code which still needed tweaking.Some of the original sample code is architecturally out of step with the current way of doing things. For example, originally ptys were found by canonically generating all pty names until one could be successfully opened. The sample code is written to return the successfully generated name. The current method in Linux (and elsewhere, I suppose) is to open(""/dev/ptmx"") and then call ptsname(). So plan on using this to study and then writing your own more modern code or tweak the sample code as needed. Of course, one of the goals of the code is to create a portable library to support various *nix flavors, so this criticism may be overstated.Still, it seems a thorough modernization of the sample code would have made this book more valuable. But as I said, I am not programming in the Sun or BSD environment.",Computers

Bradford,0/0,4.0,1360627200,good fantasy romance,"This book, though not ""great literature"", is a fun read, with plenty of romance and suspense. But you have to be willing to temporarily (for the duration of reading the book) believe in magic, including magical time travel, to let yourself get into the story. This book does have an engrossing, suspenseful story line in addition to the romance, so it is much better than those romance books that are simply an evolving romance held together by boring daily life events. I recommend it as good entertainment reading.",Fiction

It is interesting to read about the &quot;bad&quot; decisions made by the Captain and officers, by avoiding certain islands(which would have saved lives ultimately)because of a fear of island &quot;cannibilism&quot;. It shows the lack of knowledge or communication present during this era. The last chapters of the book are very captivating, in which the crew resorts to the true essence of survival in the human species( I don't want to spoil the story by describing the details!) This really made me think of how we, as human beings, take everyday things for granted. I think that this book brings us back to &quot;reality&quot; of just how fragile our lives are! A great history book. If you think those &quot;reality&quot; TV survival shows are tough, you need to read a &quot;real&quot; survival story, this one wasn't made for TV ratings!!!",History

I am putting it in my top five. It is that rare bit of nonfiction that keeps you on the edge of your seat. I am an avid horror reader, and although technically this book doesn't fit that genre, I am making a place for it on my horror shelf. This truly is a tragedy, and the depths of Captain Pollard's misfortune is staggering. Granted he wasn't a ""fishy man,"" but he is a character you rooted for. Chase, more captain than first mate, was the true leader. He kept an almost obsessive watch over the rations and kept his battered boat in sailing shape despite the seemingly insurmountable odds set before his crew. This is an outstanding book. Philbrick is an excellent writer. I particularly like the way he handled the explanation of starvation and the effects on the psyche. I've heard some call the section about cannibalism gruesome, and it was, but in order to understand the sheer power of this tragedy, it was tactfully and, I think, brilliantly handled in this regard by Philbrick.Kudos to the author and kudos to the lucky reader who picks up this book!",History
0394779959,Summer of My German Soldier,,,,9/9,3.0,1115424000,I Watched The Movie First and Than Read This Book!,"Summer Of My German Soldier is an interesting book, I actually watched the movie first and than read the book. This is about Patty a 13 year old Jewish girl growing up in a small southern town during World War II and in this little rural town there is a prisioner of war camp for German POWs and Patty comes from a rotten dysfunctional home in which her cruel father is an abusive drunk who for some reason hates her and is always beating her up and her mother is an uncaring wimp who also hates her but for some reason Patty's parent's love and adore her little sister Sharon and the only love Patty gets is from the family's black housekeeper and than Patty meets an escaped German POW who it turns out was forced into the German Army and hated Hitler and she strikes up a friendship with him and he is kind to her. This is a sad but good book though I have heard that it and the movie are considered to be controversial. The book was turned into a made for TV movie in 1978 and the cast for the movie includes Kristy McNichol as Patty, Bruce Davidson as Anton the escaped POW, Ester Rolle as Ruth the housekeeper, Michael Constantine as Patty's father, Barbara Barrie as Patty's mother and Robin Lively as Patty's little sister Sharon. The movie is available on video and Amazon is offering it though I think it's out of print so you would have to look for used tapes.",Juvenile Fiction
